CHAPTER ONE 


Amerigo Bonasera sat in New York Criminal Court 
Number 3 and waited for justice; vengeance on the men who 
had so cruelly hurt his daughter, who had tried to dishonour her. 

The judge, a formidably heavy-featured man, rolled up the 
sleeves of his black robe as if to physically chastise the two 
young men standing before the bench. His face was cold with 
majestic contempt. But there was something fake in alfthis 
that Amerigo Bonasera sensed but did not yet understand. 

‘You acted like the worst kind of degenerates,* the judge 
said harshly. Yes, yes, thought Amerigo Bonasera. Animak. 
Animak. l^e two young men, glossy hair crew cut, scrubbed 
clean-cut faces composed into humble contrition, bowed their 
heads in submksion. 

^The judge went on. ‘You acted like wild beasts in a jungle 
and you are fortunate you did not sexually molest that poor 
girl or rd put you behind bars for twenty years.* The judge 
paused, his eyes beneath impressively thick brows flickered 
slyly towards the sallow-faced Amerigo Bonasera, then 
lowered to a stack of probation reports befdre him. He 
frowned and shrugged as if convinced against his own natural 
desire. He spoke again. 

‘But because of yotir youth, your dean records, because of 
your fine families, and b^use the law in its majesty does not 
seek vengeance, I hereby sentence you to three years’ con- 
finement to the penitentiary. Sentence to be suspended.* 

Only forty years of profosional mourning I^t the over- 
whelming frustration a^ hatred from showing on Amerigo 


7 



Bonasera’s face. His beautiful young daughter was still in the 
hospital with her broken jaw wired together; and now these 
two animaks went free? It had all been a farce. He watched the 
happy parents cluster around their darling sons. Oh, they 
were all happy now, they were smiling now. 

The black bile, sourly bitter, rose in Bonasera’s throat, over- 
flowed through tightly clenched teeth. He used his white linen 
pocket handkerchief and held it against his lips. He was stand- 
ing so when the two young men strode freely up the aisle, 
confident and cool-eyed, smiling, not giving him so much as a 
glance. He let them pass without saying a word, pressing the 
fresh linen against his mouth. 

The parents of the animaks were coming by now, two men 
and two women his age but more American in their dress. 
They glanced at him, shamefaced, yet in their eyes was an odd, 
triumphant defiance. 

Out of control, Bonasera leaned forward towards the aisle 
and shouted hoarsely, * You will weep as I have wept - I wiU 
make you weep as your children make me weep ’ - the linen at 
his eyes now. The defence attorneys bringing up the rear 
swept their clients forward in a tight little band, enveloping 
the two young men, who had started back down the aisle as if 
to protect their parents. A huge bailifiF moved quickly to block 
the row in which Bonasera stood. But it Was not necessary. 

All his years in America, Amerigo Bonasera had trusted in 
law and order. And he had prospered thereby! Now, though 
his brain smoked with hatred, though wild visions of buying a 
gun and killing the two young men jangled the very bones of 
his skull, Bonasera turned to his still uncomprehending wife 
and explained to her, *They have made fools of us.’ He paused 
and thpn made his decision, no longer fearing the cost. *For 
justice we must go on our knees to Don G>rleone.’ 

In a garishly decorated Los Angeles hotel suite, Johnny 
Fontane was as jealously drunk as any ordinary husband. 
Sprawled on a red couch, he drank straight from the bottle of 
Scotch in his hand, then washed the taste away by dunking his 
mouth in a crystalbucketoficecubes and water. It was four in the 
morning and he was spinning drunkenfimtasies of murdetinghis 

8 



trampy wife when she got home. If she ever did come home. It 
was too late to call his first wife and ask about the kids and 
he felt funny about calling any of his friends now that his career 
was plunging downhill. Hierchad becnatime when they would 
have been delighted, flattered by his calling them at four in the 
morning but now he bored them. He could even smile a little to 
himself as he thought that on ijic way up Johnny Fontanels tro- 
ubles had fascinated some of the greatest female stars in America. 

Gulping at his bottle of Scotch, he heard finally his wife’s 
key in the door, but he kept drinking until she walked into the 
room and stood before him. She was to him so very beautiful, 
the angelic face, soulful violet eyes, the delicately fragile but 
perfectly formed body. On the screen her beauty was magni- 
fied, spiritualized. A hundred million men all over the world 
were in love with the face of Margot Ashton. And paid to see 
it on the screen. 

* Where the hell were you?’ Johnny Fontane asked. 

* Out fucking,’ she said. 

She had misjudged his drunkenness. He sprang over the 
cocktai) table and grabbed her by the throat. But close up to 
that magical face, the lovely violet eyes, he lost his anger and 
became . helpless again. She made the mistake of smiling 
mockingly, saw his fist draw back. She screamed, ^Johnny, not 
in the face, I’m making a picture.’ 

She was laughing. He punched her in the stomach and .she 
fell to the floor. He fell bn top of her. He could smell her 
fragrant breath as she gasped for air. He punched her on the 
arms and on the thigh muscles of her silky tanned legs. He 
beat her as he had beaten snott^^maller kids long ago when he 
had been a tough teenager in New York’s Hell’s Kitchen. A 
painful punishment that would leave no lasting dis^guremenr 
of loosened teeth or broken nose. 

But he was not bitting her hard enough. He couldn’t. And 
she 'was giggling at him. Spread-eagl^ on the floor, her 
brocaded gown hitched up atove her thighs, she taunted him 
between giggles. *Comc on, stick it in. Stick it in, Johnny, 
that’s what you really want.’ 

Johnny Fontane got up. He hated the woman on the floor, 
but her beauty was a magic shield. Margot rolled away, and tn 


9 



a daticer’s spring was on her feet £icing him. She went into a 
childish mocking dance and chanted^ * Johnny never hurt me, 
Johnny never hurt me.* Then almost sadly with grave beauty 
she said, ‘You poor silly bastard, giving me cramps like a kid. 
Ah, Johnny, you always will be a dumb romantic guinea, you 
even make love like a Idd. You still think screwing is really like 
those dopey songs you used to sing.* She shook her head smd 
said, ‘Poor Johnny. Goodbye, Johnny.* She walked into the 
bedroom and he heard her turn the key in the lock. 

Johnny sat on the floor with his fltce in his hands. The sick, 
humiliating despair overwhelmed him. And then the gutter 
toughness that had helped him survive the jungle of Holly- 
wood made him pick up the phone and call for a car to take 
him to the airport. There was one person who could save 
him. He would go back to New York. He would go back to 
the one man with the power, the wisdom, he needed and a love 
he still trusted. His Godfather Corleone. 

The baker, Na 2 orine, pudgy and crusty as his great Italian 
loaves, still dusty with flour, scowled at his wife, his nubile 
daughter, Katherine, and his baker’s helper, Enao. Bozo had 
changed into his prisoner-of-war uniform with its green- 
lettered armband and was terrified that this scene would make 
him late reporting back to Governor’s Island. One of the 
many thousands of Italian Army prisoners paroled daily to 
work in the American economy, he lived in constant fear of 
that parole being revoked. And so the* little comedy being 
play^ now 'was, for him, a serious business. 

Nazorine asked fiercely, ‘Have you dishonoured my fiunily? 
Have you given my daughter a litde package to remember you 
by npw that the war is over and you know America will Idck 
your ass back to your village full of shit in Sicily?* 

Enzo, a very short, strongly built boy, put his hmd oirer his 
heart and said almost in tears, yet clevedy, *Padram^ Iswcatrhy 
the Holy Virgin I have never taken advantage of your kind- 
ness. 1 love your daughter with all reQ>ect. 1 asl^ for her 
band widi all respect. 1 know 1 have no right, but if they send 
me back to Italy I can never come back to America. 1 will 
never be able to marry Katherine.* 


lO 



Na2odne*s wife, Filomena, spoke to the point. ‘ Stop all this 
foolishness/ she said to her pudgy husband. * You know what 
you must, do. Keep Enzo here, send him to hide with our 
cousins in Long Island.’ 

Katherine was weeping. She was already plump, homely, and 
sprouting a faint moustache. She would never get a husband as 
Iiandsome as Enzo, never find another man who touched her 
body in secret places with such respectful love. ‘ I’ll go and live 
in Italy,’ she screamed at her father. ‘I’ll run away if you don’t 
keep Enzo here.’ 

Nazorine glanced at her shrewdly. She was a ‘hot number’ 
this daughter of his. He had seen her brush her swelling 
buttocks .against Enzo’s front when the baker’s helper 
squeezed behind her to fill the counter baskets with hot loaves 
from the oven. The young rascal’s hot loaf would be in 
oven, Nazorine thought lewdly, if proper steps were not 
taken. Enzo must be kept in America and be made an American 
citizen. And there was only one man who could arrange $uch 
an afEsir, The Godfather. Don Corleone. 

All of these people and many others received engraved 
invitations to the wedding of Miss Constanzia Corleone, to be 
celebrated on the last Saturday in August 1945. The father of 
the bride, Don Vito Corleone, never forgot his old friends and 
neighbours though he himself now lived in a huge house on 
Long Island. The reception would be held in that house and 
the festivities would go on all day. There was no doubt it 
would be a momentous occasion. Ihe war with the Japanese 
had just ended, so there would not be any nagging fear for 
their sons fighting in the Army to cloud these festivities. A 
wedding was just what people needed to show their joy. . 

And so on that Saturday morning the friends of Don Cor* 
leone streamed out of New York City to do him honour. They 
bore cream-coloured envelopes stuffed with cash as bridal 
gifts, no cheques. Inside each envelope a card established the 
identity of the giver and the measure of his respect for the 
Godfiither. A respect truly earned. 

Don Vito torlcone was a man to whom everybody came 
for help, and never were they disappointed. He made no 


II 



empty promises, nor the craven excuse that bis hands were 
tied by more powerful forces in the world than himself. It was 
not necessary that he be your friend, it was not even important 
that you had no means with which to repay him. Only one 
thing was required. That you, joh ytutrseJf^ proclaim your 
friendship. And then, no matter how poor or powerless the 
supplicant, Don Corleone would take that man's troubles to 
his heart. And he would let nothing stand in the way to a 
solution of that man’s woe. His reward? Friendship, the 
respectful title of ‘Don*, and sometimes the more affectionate 
salutation of ‘Godfather’. And perhaps, to show respect only, 
never for profit, some humble gift - a gallon of homemade 
wine or a basket of peppered iarclUs specially baked to grace 
his Christmas table. It was understo^ it was mete good 
manners, to proclaim that you were in his debt and that he 
had the right to call upon you at any time to redeem your 
debt by some small service. 

Now on this great day, his daughter’s wedding day, Don 
Vito Corleone stood in the doorway of his Long Beach home 
to greet his guests, all of them known, all of them trusted. 
Many of them owed their good fortune in life to the Don and 
on this intimate occasion felt free to call him ‘Godfather’ to 
his face. Even the people performing festal services were his 
friends. The bartender was an old comrade whose gift was all 
the wedding liqueurs and his own expert skills. The waiters 
were the friends of Don Corleone’s sons. The food on the 
garden picnic tables had been cooked by the Don’s wife and 
her friends, and the gaily festooned one-acre garden itself had 
been decorated by the young girl-chums of the bride. 

Don Corleone received everyone - rich and poor, powerful 
and humble - with an equal show of love. He slighted no one. 
That was his character. And the guests so exclaimed at bow 
well he looked in his tux that an inexperienced observer might 
easily have thought the Don himself was the lucky groom. 

Standing at the door with him were two of his three sons. 
The eldest, baptized Santino but called Sonny by everyone 
except his father, was looked at askance by the older Italian 
men; with admiration by the younger. Sonny Corleone was 
tall for a first-generation American of Italian parentage. 


12 



almost six feet, and his crop of bushy, curly hair made liim 
look even taller. His face was that of a gross Cupid, the 
features even but the bow-shaped lips thickly sensual, the 
dimpled cleft chin in some curious way obscene. He was built 
as powerfully as a bull, and it was common knowledge that he 
was so generously endowed by nature that his martyred wife 
feared the marriage bed as unbelievers once feared the rack. 
It was whispered that when as a youth he had visited houses of 
iU fame, even the most hardened and fearless putain^ after an 
awed inspection of his massive organ, demanded double 
price. 

Here at the wedding feast, some young matrons, wide- 
hipped, wide-mouthed, measured Sonny Corleonc with cooDy 
confident eyes. But on this particular day they were wasting 
their time. Sonny Corleone, despite the presence of his wife 
and three small children, had plans for his sister’s maid of 
honour, Lucy Mancini. This young girl, fully aware, sat at a 
garden table iti her pink formal gown, a tiara of dowers in her 
glossy black hair. She had dirted with Sonny in the past week 
of rehearsals and squeezed his hand that morning at the altar. 
A maiden could do no more. 

She did not care that he ^ ould never be the great man his 
father had proved to be. Sonny Corleonc had strength, he had 
courage. He was generous and his heart was admitted to be as 
big as his organ. Yet he did not have his father’s humility but 
instead a quick, hot temper that led him into errors of judge- 
ment. Though he was a great help in his father’s business, 
there were many who doubted that he would become the 
heir to it. 

The second son, Frcdcrico, called Fred or Frtdo, was a 
child every Italian prayed to the saints for. Dutiful, loyal, 
always at the service of Us father, living with his patents at age 
thirty. He was short and burly, not handsome but with the 
same Cupid head of the famOy, the curly helmet of hair over 
the round face and sensual bow-shaped Kps. Only, in Fred, 
these lips were not sensual but graniteKke. Inclined to dour- 
ness, he was stiU a crutch to his &ther, never disputed him, 
never embarrassed him by scandalous behaviour with women. 
Despite all these virtues, he did not have that personal 

15 



magnetism, that animal force, so necessary for a leader of men, 
and he, too, was not expected to inherit the family business. 

The third son, Michael Corleone, did not stand with his 
father and his two brothers but sat at a table in the most 
secluded corner of the garden. But even there he could not 
escape the attentions of the family friends. 

Michael Corleone was the youngest son of the Don and the 
only child who had refused the great man’s direction. He did 
not have the heavy, Cupid-shaped face of the other children, 
and. his jet black hair was straight rather than curly. His skin 
was a clear olive-brown that would have been called beautiful 
in a girl. He was handsome in a delicate way. Indeed there had 
been a time when the Don had worried about his youngest 
son’s masculinity. A worry that was put to rest when Michael 
Corleone became seventeen years old. 

Now this youngest son sat at a table in the extreme comer 
of the garden to proclaim his chosen alienation from father 
and family. Beside him sat the American girl everyone had 
heard about but whom no one had seen until this day. He had, 
of course, shown the proper respect and introduced her to 
everyone at the wedding, including his family. They were not 
impressed with her. She was too thin, she was too fair, her 
face was too sharply intelligent for a woman, her manner too 
free for a maiden. Her name, too, was outlandish to their 
ears ; she called herself Kay Adams. If she had told them that 
her family had settled in America two hundred years ago and 
her name was a common one, they would have shrugged. 

Every guest noticed that the Don paid no particular atten- 
tion to this third son. Michael had been hiS favourite before 
the vfar and obviously the chosen heir to run the family 
business when the proper moment came. He had all the quiet 
force and intelligence of his great father, the born instinct to 
act in such a way that men had no recourse but to respect him. 
But when World War II broke out, Michael Corleone volun- 
teered for the Marine Corps. He defied his father’s express 
command when he did so. 

Don Corleone had no desire, no intention, of letdng his 
youngest son be killed in the service of a power foreign to 
hims^. Doctors had been bribed, secret arrangements had 

M 



been made. A gteat deal of money had been spent to take*the 
proper precautions. But Midbael was twenty-one years of age 
and nothing could be done against his own wilfulness. He 
enlisted and fought over the Pacific Ocean. He became a 
Captain and won medals. In 1944 his picture was printed in 
Uft magazine with a 'photo layout of his deeds. A friend had 
shown Don Corleone the magazine (his family did not dare), 
and the Don had grunted disdainfully and said, ‘ He performs 
those miracles for strangers.’ 

When Michael Corleone was discharged early in 1945 to 
recover from a disabling wound he had no idea that his father 
had arranged his release. He stayed home for a few weeks, 
then, without consulting anyone, entered Dartmouth College 
in Hanover, New Hampshire, and so he left his father’s house. 
To return for the wedding of his sister and to show his own 
future wife to them, the washed-out rag of an American girl. 

Michael Corleone was amusing Kay Adams by telling her 
Uttle stories about some of the more colourful wedding guests. 
He was, in turn, amused by her finding these people exotic, 
and, as always, charmed by her intense interest in anything 
new and foreign to her experience. Finally her attention was 
caught by a small group of men gathered around a wooden 
barrel of homemade wine. The men were Amerigo Bonasera, 
Nazorine the baker, Anthony Coppola, and Luca Brasi. With 
her usual alert intelligence she remarked on the fact that these 
four men did not seem particularly happy. Michael smiled. 

•No, they’re not,’ he said. ^They’re waiting to see my father 
in private. They have favours to ask.’ And indeed it was easy to 
see that all four men constantly followed the Don with their eyes. 

As Don Corleone stood greeting guests, a black Chevrolet 
sedan came to a stop on the far side of the paved mall. Two 
men in the front seat puUed notebooks from their jackets and, 
with no attempt at concealment, jotted down licence numbers 
of the other cars parked around tne mall. Sonny turned to his 
father and said, ‘Those guys over there must be cops.’ 

Don Corleone shrugged. ‘1 don’t own the street. They can 
do what they please.’ 

Sonny’s heavy Cupid fyot grew ted with anger. ‘Those 



lousy bastards, they don’t respect anything.* He left the steps 
of the house and walked across the mall to where the black 
sedan was parked. He thrust his face angrily close to the face 
of the driver, who did not flinch but flapped open his wallet 
to show a green identification card. Sonny stepped back 
without saying a word. He spat so that the spittle hit the back 
door of the sedan and walked away. He was hoping the driver 
would get out of the sedan and come after him, on the mall, 
but nothing happened. When he reached the steps he said to 
his father, ‘Those guys arc FBI men. They’re taldng down all 
the licence numbers. Snotty bastards.’ 

Don Corlcone knew who they were. His closest and most 
intimate friends had been advised to attend the wedding in 
automobiles not their own. And though he disapproved of his 
son’s foolish displa^^ of auger, the tantrum served a purpose. It 
would convince the interlopers that their presence was un- 
expected and unprepared for. So Don Corlcone himself was 
not angry. He had long ago learned that society imposes 
insults that must be borne, comforted by the knowledge that 
in this world there comes a time when the most humble of 
men, if he keeps his eyes open, can take his revenge on the 
most powerful. It was this knowledge that prevented the Don 
from losing the humility all his friends admired in him. 

But now in the garden behind the house, a four-piece band 
began to play. All the guests had arrived. Don Corlcone put the 
intruders out of his mind and led his two sons to the wedding 
feast. 

There were, now, hundreds of guests in the huge garden, 
some dancing on the wooden platform bedecked with fl.owcrs, 
others' sitting at long tables piled high with spicy food and 
gallon jugs of black, homemade wine. The bride, Connie 
Corlcone, sat in splendour at a special raised table with her 
groon\ the maid of honour, bridesmaids, and ushers. It was a 
rustic setting in the old Italian style. Not to the bride’s taste, but 
Connie had consented to a ‘ guinea ’ wedding to please her father 
because she had so displeasured him in her choice of a husband. 

The groom. Carlo Rixzi, was a half-breed, bom of a Sicilian 
fiither and the North Italian mother from whom he had 

i6 



inherited his blond hair and blue eyes. His parents li^ed in 
Nevada and Carlo had left that state because of a little trouble 
with the law. In New York he met Sonny Corleone and so met 
the sister. Don Corleone, of course, sent trusted friends to 
Nevada and they reported that Carlo’s police trouble was a 
youthful indiscretion with a gun, not serious, that could 
easily be wiped off the books to leave the youth with a dean 
record. They also came back with detailed information on legal 
gambling in Nevada which greatly interested the Don and 
which he had been pondering over since. It was part of the 
Don's greatness that he profited from everything. 

Connie Corleone was a not quite pretty girl, thin and 
nervous and certain to become shrewish later in life. But 
today, transformed by her white bridal gown and eager 
virginity, she was so radiant as to be almost beautiful. Beneath 
the wooden table her hand rested on the muscular thigh of her 
groom. Her Cupid-bow mouth pouted to give him an airy 
Uss. 

She thought him incredibly handsome. Carlo Rizzi had 
worked in the open desert air while very young - heavy 
labourer’s work. Now he had tremendous forearms and his 
shoulders bulged the jacket of his tux. He basked in the 
adoring eyes of his bride and filled her glass with wine. He 
was elaborately courteous to her as if they were both actors in 
a play. But his eyes kept flickering towards the huge silk purse 
the bride wore on her right shoulder and whic^ was now 
stuffed full of money envelopes. How much did it hold? Ten 
thousand? Twenty thousand? Carlo Rizzi smiled. It was only 
the beginning. He had, after all, married into a royal family. 
They would have to take cate of him. , 

In the crowd of guests a dapper young man with the sleek 
head of a ferret was also studying the silk purse. From sheer 
habit Paulie Gatto wondered just how he could go about 
hijacking that fat pocketbook. The idea amused him. But he 
knew it was idle, innocent dreaming, as small children dream 
of knocking out tanks with pop-guns. He watched his boss, fat, 
middle-aged Peter Qemenza whiding young girls around the 
wooden dance floor in a rustic and lusty TaranttUa, Qemenza, 
immensely tall, immensely huge, danced with such skill and 



abandon, his hard belly lecherously bumping the breasts of 
younger, tinier women, that all the guests were applauding 
him. Older women grabbed his arm to become his next 
partner. The younger men respectfully cleared off the floor and 
clapped their hands in time to the mandolin’s wild strumming. 
When Qemenaa finally collapsed in a chair, Paulie Gatto 
brought him a glass of icy. black wine and wiped the per- 
spiring Jovelike brow with his silk handkerchief. Clemenaa 
was blowing like a whale as he gulped down the wine. But 
instead of thanking Paulie he said curtly, * Never mind being a 
dance judge, do your job. Take a walk around the neighbour- 
hood and see everything is OK.’ Paulie slid away into the 
crowd. 

The band took a refreshment break. A young man named 
Nino Valenti picked up a discarded mandolin, put his left foot 
up on a chair, and began to sing a coarse Sicilian love song. 
Nino Valenti’s face was handsome though bloated by con- 
tinual drinking and he was already a little drunk. He rolled his 
eyes as his tongue caressed the obscene lyrics. The women 
shrieked with glee and the men shouted the last word of each 
stanza with the singer. 

Don Corleone, notoriously straitlaced in such matters, 
though his stout wife was screaming jo3rfully with the others, 
disappeared tactfully into the house. Seeing this. Sonny 
Corleone made his way to the bride*s table and sat down 
beside young Lucy Mancini, the maid of honour. They were 
safe. His wife was in the kitchen putting the last touches on the 
serving of the wedding cake. Sonny whispered a few words in 
the young girl’s ear and she rose. Sonny waited a few minutes 
and then casually followed her, stopping to talk with a guest 
here and there as he worked his way through the crowd. 

All eyes followed them. The maid of honour, thoroughly 
Americanized by three years of college, was a ripe girl who 
already had a ‘reputation*. All through the marriage re- 
hearsals she had flirted with Sonny Corleone in a teasing, 
joking way she thought was permitted because he was the best 
man and her wedding partner. Now holding her pink gown up 
off the ground, Lucy Mancini went into the house, smiling 
with false innocence, ran lightly up the stairs to ^e bath- 

18 



room. She stayed there for a few moments. When she came out 
Sonny Cotkone was on the landing above, beckoning her 
upward. 

From behind the closed window of Don Codeone’s * ofiice', 
a slightly raised corner room, Thomas Hagen watched the 
wedding party in the festooned garden. The walls behind 
him were stacked with law books. Hagen was the Don’s 
lawyer and acting Consigiiori^ or counsellor, and as such held 
the most vital subordinate position in the family business* He 
and die Don had solved many a knotty problem in this room, 
and so when he saw the Gc^ather leave the festiviues and 
enter the house, he knew, wedding or no, there would be a 
litde work this day. The Don would be coming to see him. 
Then Hagen saw Sonny Corleone whisper in Lucy Mancini’s 
ear and their litde comedy as he followed her into the house. 
Hagen grimaced, debated whether to inform the Don, and 
decided against it. He went to the desk and picked up a hand- 
written list of the people who had been granted permission to 
see Don Corleone privately. When the Don entered the room 
Hagen handed him the list. Don Corleone nodded and said, 
’Leave Bonasera to the end. ’ 

Hagen used the french doors and went directly out into the 
garden to where the supplicants clustered around the barrel of 
wine. He pointed to the baker, the pudgy Nazorine. 

Don Corleone greeted the baker with an embrace. They had 
played together as children in Italy and had grown up in 
friendship. Every Easter freshly baked clotted-cheese and 
wheat-germ pies, their crusts yolk-gold, big around as truck 
wheels, surrived at Don Corleone’s home. On Christmas, on 
fiunily birthdays, rich creamy pastries proclaimed* the Nazo- 
rines* respect. And all through the years, lean and fat, Nazo- 
rine cheerfully paid his dues to the l^ery union organized by 
the Don in his salad days. Never asking for a favour in return 
except for the chance to buy black-market OPA sugar 
coupons during the war. Now the time had come for the baker 
to oaim his rights as a loyal friend, and Don Corleone looked 
forward '4rith great pleasure to granting his request. 

He gave the baker a Di Nobili cigar and a glass of ydlow 
Stt^and put his hand on the man’s shotdder to urge him on. 


19 



That was the mark of the Don’s humanity. He knew from 
bitter experience what courage it took to ask a favour from a 
fellow man. 

The baker told the story of his daughter and Enzo. A fine 
Italian lad from Sicily; captured by the American Army; sent 
to the United States as a prisoner of war; given parole to help 
our war effort! A pure and honourable love had sprung up 
between honest Enzo and his sheltered Katherine, but now 
that the war was ended the poor lad would be repatriated to 
Italy and Nazorine’s daughter would surely die of a broken 
heart. Only Godfather Corleone could help this afflicted 
couple. He was their last hope. 

The Don walked Nazorine up and down the room, his hand 
on the baker’s shoulder, his head nodding with understanding 
to keep up the man’s courage. When the baker had finished 
Don Corleone smiled at him and said, ‘ My dear friend, put all 
your worries aside.’ He went on to explain very carefully what 
must be done. The Congressman of the district must be 
petitioned. The Congressman would propose a special bill that 
would allow Enzo to become a citizen. The bill would surely 
pass Congress. A privilege all those rascals extended to each 
other. Don Corleone explained that this would cost money, 
the going price was now two thousand dollars. He, Don 
Corleone, would guarantee performance and accept payment. 
Did his friend agree? 

The baker nodded his head vigorously. He did not expect 
such a great favour for nothing. That was understood. A 
special Act of Congress docs not come cheap. Nazorine was 
almost tearful in his thanks. Don Corleone walked him to the 
door, assuring him that competent people would be sent to the 
bakery*to arrange all details, complete all necessary documents. 
The baker embraced him before disappearing into the 
garden. 

Hagen smiled at the Don. ‘That’s a good investment for 
Nazorine. A son-in-law and a cheap lifetime helper in his 
bakery all for two thousand dollars.’ He paused. ‘Who do I 
give this job to?* 

Don Corleone frowi^d in thought. ‘Nor to our paisan. Give 
it to the Jew in the next district. Have the home addresses 


ao 



changed. 1 think thete might be many such cases now the war 
is over; we should have extra people in Washington that can 
handle the overflow and not raise the price.’ Hagen made a 
note on his pad. ‘Not Congressman Luteco. Try Fischer.’ 

The next man Hagen brought in was a very simple case. His 
name was Anthony Coppola and he was the son of a man Don 
Corleone had worked with in the railroad yards in his youth. 
Coppola needed five hundred dollars to open a pizzeria ; for a 
deposit on fixtures and the special oven. For reasons not 
gone into, credit was not available. The Don reached into his 
pocket and took out a roll of bills. It was not quite enough. He 
grimaced and said to Tom Hagen, ‘Loan me a hundred 
dollars, I’ll pay you back Monday when I go to the bank.’ The ' 
supplicant protested that four hundred dollars would be 
ample, but Don Corleone patted his shoulder, saying, apolo- 
getically, ‘This fancy wedding left me a little short of cash.’ 
He took the money Hagen extended to him and gave it to 
Anthony Coppola with his own roll of bills. 

Hagen watched with quiet admiration. The Don always 
taught that when a man was generous, he must show the 
generosity as personal. How flattering to Anthony Coppola 
that a man like the Don would borrow to loan him money. Not 
that Coppola did not know that the Don was a millionaire, but 
how many millionaires let themselves be put to even a small 
inconvenience by a poor friend? 

The Don raised his head inquiringly. Hagen said, ‘He’s not 
on the h'st but Luca Brasi wants to see you. He understands it 
can’t be public but he wants to congratulate you in person.’ 

For the first time the Don seemed displeased. The answer 
was devious. ‘Is it necessary?’ he asked. , 

Hagen shrugged. ‘You understand him better than I do. 
But he was very grateful that you invited him to the wedding. 
He never expected that. I think he wants to show his gratitude.’ 

Don Corleone nodded and gestured that Luca Brasi should 
be brought to him. 

In the garden Kay Adams was struck by the violet fury 
imprinted on the face of Luca Brasi. She asked about him. 
Michael had brought Kay to the wedding so that she would 
slowly, and perhaps without too much of a shock, absorb the 


21 



tnith about his father. But so fat she seemed to regard the 
Don as a slightly unethical businessman. Michael decided to 
tell her part of the truth indirectly. He explained that Luca 
Brasi was one of the most feared men in the Eastern under- 
world. His great talent, it was said, was that he could do a job 
of murder all by himself, without confederates, which auto- 
matically made discovery and conviction by the law almost 
impossible. Michael grimaced and said, don’t know whether 
all that stuff is true. I do know he is sort of a friend to my 
Bither.’ 

For the first time Kay began to understand. She asked a little 
incredulously, * You’re not hinting that a man like that works 
for your father?’ 

llie heU with it, he thought. He said, straight out, ‘Nearly 
fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father’s 
oil importing business. They tried to kill him and nearly did. 
Luca Brasi went after them. The story is that he killed six men 
in two weeks and that ended the famous olive oil war.’ He 
smiled as if it were a joke. 

Kay shuddered. ‘You mean your father was shot by 
gangsters?’ 

‘Fifteen years ago,’ Michael said. ‘Everything’s been peace- 
ful since then.’ He was afraid he had gone too far. 

‘You're trying to scare me,’ Kay said. ‘You just don’t want 
me to marry you.’ She smiled at him and poked his ribs with 
her elbow. ‘Very clever.’ 

Michael smiled back at her. ‘1 want you to think about it,’ he 
said. 

‘Did he really kill six men?’ Kay asked. 

‘That’s what the newspapers claimed,’ Mike said. ‘Nobody 
ever proved it. But there’s another story about him that 
nobody ever tells. It’s supposed to be so terrible that even my 
father won’t talk about it. Tom Hagen knows the story and he 
won’t tell me. Once I kidded him, 1 said, “When will I be old 
enough to hear that story about Luca?’’ and Tom said, “When 
you’re a hundred.”' Michael sipped his glass of wine. ‘That 
must be some story. That must be some Luca.’ 

Luca Brasi was indeed a man to frighten the devil in hell 
himself. Short, squat, massive-skulled, his presence sent out 


22 



aknn bdb of danger. HU &ce vas stamped into a mask of 
fury. The eyes were brown but with none of the warmth 
of that colour, more a deadly tan. The mouth was not so 
much cruel as lifeless; thin, rubbery, and the colour of 
veal. 

Brasi’s reputation for violence was awesome and his devo- 
tion to Don Corleone legendary. He was, in himself, one of the 
great blocks that supported the Don’s power structure. His 
kind was a rarity. 

Luca Brasi did not feat the police, he did not fear society, he 
did not fear God, he did not fear hell, he did not fear or love 
his fellow man. Put he had elected, he had chostn^ to fear and 
love I>on Corleone. Ushered into the presence of the Don, the 
terrible Brasi held himself sti£F with respect. He stuttered over 
the flowery congratulations he offered and his formal hope 
that the first grandchild would be masculine. He then handed 
the Don an envelope stuffed with cash as a gift for the bridal 
couple. 

So that was what he wanted to do. Hagen noticed the 
change in Don Corleone. The Don received Brasi as a king 
greets a subject who has done him an enormous service, never 
fiimiliar but with regal respect. With every gesture, with every 
word, Don Corleone made it clear to Luca Brasi that he was 
pahtid. Not for one moment did he show surprise at the 
wedding gift being presented to him personally. He under- 
stood. 

The money in the envelope was sure to be more than anyone 
else had given. Brasi had spent many hours deciding on the 
sum, comparing it to what the other guests might offer. He 
wanted to be the most generous to show that he h^d the most 
respect, and that was why he had given his envdope to the 
Don personally, a gauchc^e the Don overlooked in his own 
flowery sentence of thanks. Hagen saw Luca Brasi’s face lose 
its mask of fury, swell with pdde and pleasiire, Brasi kissed the 
Don’s hand before he went out the door that Hagen held 
open. Hagen prudently gave Brasi a fdendly smile which the 
squat man admowledged with a polite stretdung of rubbery, 
veal-coloured lips. 

^ When the door closed Don Corleone gave a small sigh of 

*1 



relief. Brasi was the only man in the world who could make 
him nervous. The man was like a natural force, not truly 
subject to control. He had to be handled as gingerly as dyna- 
mite. The Don shrugged. Even dynamite could be exploded 
harmlessly if the need arose. He looked qucstioningly at 
Hagen. 'Is Bonasera the only one left?’ 

Hagen nodded. Don Corleone frowned in thought, then 
said, ‘ Before you bring him in, teU Santino to come here. He 
should learn some things.* 

Out in the garden, Hagen searched anxiously for Sonny 
Corleone. He told the waiting Bonasera to be patient and went 
over to Michael Corleone and his girlfriend. ‘Did you sec 
Sonny around?’ he asked. Michael shook his head. Damn, 
Hagen thought, if Sonny was screwing the maid of honour all 
this time there was going to be a mess of trouble. His wife, the 
young girl’s family; it could be a disaster. Anxiously he 
hurried to the entrance through which he had seen Sonny 
disappear almost a half hour ago. 

Seeing Hagen go into the house, Kay Adams asked Michael 
Corleone, *Who is he? You introduced him as your brother, 
but his name is different and be certainly doesn’t look Italian.’ 

‘Tom lived with us since he was twelve years old,’ Michael 
said. ‘His parents died and he was roaming around the streets 
with this bad eye infection. Sonny brought him home one 
night and he just stayed. He didn’t have any place to go. He 
lived with us until he got married.’ 

Kay Adams was thrilled. ‘That’s really romantic,’ she said. 
‘Your father must be a warmhearted person. To adopt some- 
body just like that when he had so many children of his own.’ 

Michael didn’t bother to point out that immigrant Italians 
considered four children a smaU family. He merely said, 'Tom 
wasn’t adopted. He just lived with us.’ 

‘Oh,’ Kay said, then asked curiously, ‘why didn’t you adopt 
him?’ 

Michael laughed. ‘Because my father said it would be dis- 
respectful for Tom to change his name. Disrespectful to his 
own parents.’ 

They saw Hagen shoo Sonny through the french door into 
the Don’s office and then crook a finger at Amerigo Bonasera. 


M 



'Why do they bother your father with business on a day like 
this?’ Kay asked. 

Michael laughed again. ' Because they know that by tradition 
no Sicilian can refuse a request on his daughter’s wedding 
day. And no Sicilian erer lets a chance like that go by.’ 

Lucy Manciiii lifted her pink gown oH^ the floor and ran up 
the steps. Sonny Corleone’s heavy Cupid face, redly obscene 
with winey lust, frightened her, but she had teased him for the 
past week to just this end. In her two college love affairs she 
had felt nothing and neither of them lasted more than a week. 
Quarrelling, her second lover had mumbled something about 
her being 'too big down there’. Lucy had understood and for 
the rest of the school term had reused to go out on any 
dates. 

During the summer, preparing for the wedding of her best 
friend, Connie Corleone, Lucy heard the whispered stories 
about Sonny. One Sunday afternoon in the Corleone kitchen. 
Sonny’s wife Sandra gossiped freely. Sandra was a coarse, 
good-natured woman who had been born in Italy but brought 
to America as a small child. She was strongly built with great 
breasts and had already borne three children in five years of 
marriage. Sandra and the other women teased Connie about 
the terrors of the nuptial bed. *My God,’ Sandra had giggled, 
'when I saw that pole of Sonny’s for the first time and realized 
he was going to stick it into I yelled bloody murder. After 
the first year my insides felt as mushy as macaroni boiled for 
an hour. When I heard he was doing the job on other girls I 
went to church and lit a candle.’ 

They had all laughed, but Lucy had felt her flesh twitching 
between her legs. 

Now as she ran up the steps towards Sonny a tremendous 
flash of desire went through her body. On the landing Sonny 
grabbed her hand and pulled her down the hall into an empty 
i^droom. Her legs went weak as the door dosed behind them. 
She fdt Sonny’s moudi on hers, his lips tasting of burnt 
tobacco, bitter. She opened her mouth. At that moment she 
felt his hand come up beneath her bridesmaid’s gown, heard 
die rusde of material giving way, fidt his large warm hand 


*5 



between her legs, tipping aside the satin panties to caress her 
vulva. She put her arms around his neck and hung there as he 
opened his trousers. Then be placed both hands beneath her 
bare buttocks and lifted her. She gave a little hop in the air so 
that both her legs were wrapped around his upper thighs. His 
tongue was in her mouth and she sucked on it. He gave a 
savage thrust that banged her head against the door. She felt 
something burning pass between her thighs. She let her right 
hand drop from his neck and reached down to guide him . 
Her hand closed around an enormous, blood-gorged pole of 
muscle. It pulsated in her hand like an animal and almost 
weeping with grateful ecstasy she pointed it into her own wet, 
turgid flesh. The thrust of its entering, the unbelievable 
pleasure made her gasp, brought her legs up almost around his 
neck, and then like a quiver, her body received the savage 
arrows of his lightning-like thrusts; innumerable, torturing; 
arching her pelvis higher and higher until for the first time in 
her life she reached a shattering climax, felt his hardness break 
smd then the crawly flood of semen over her thighs. Slowly 
her legs relaxed from around his body, slid down until they 
reach^ the floor. They leaned against each other, out of 
breath. 

It might have been going on for ;8ome time, but now they 
could hear the soft knocking on the door. Sonny quickly 
buttoned his trousers, meanwhile blocking the door so that it 
could not be opened. Lucy frantically smoothed down her 
pink gown, her eyes flickering, but the thing that had given 
her so much pleasure was hidden inside sober black cloth. 
Then they heard Tom Hagen’s voice, very low, ‘Sonny, you 
in there?’ 

Sonhy sighed with relief. He winked at Lucy. ‘Yeah, Tom, 
what is it?’ 

Hagen’s voice, still low, said, ‘The Don wants you in his 
oflice. Now.’ They could hear his footsteps as he walked away. 
Sonny waited for a few moments, gave Lucy a hard kiss on t^ 
lips, and then slipped out the door after Hagen. 

Lucy combed her hair. She checked her dress and pulled 
around her garter straps. Her body felt bruised, her lips pulpy 
and tender. She went out the door; and though she felt the 

a6 



sticky wetness between het thighs she did not go to the bath- 
room to wash but ran straight on down the steps and into the 
garden. She took her seat at the bridal table next to Q>nnie, 
who exclaimed petulantly, ‘Lucy, where were you? You look 
drunk. Stay beside me now.* 

The blond groom poured Lucy a glass of wine and smiled 
knowingly. Lucy didn’t care. She lifted the gtapey, dark red 
juice to her pa^ed mouth and drank. She fdt the sticky 
wetness between her thighs and pressed her legs together. 
Her body was trembling. Over the glass rim, as she drank, her 
eyes searched hungrily to find Sonny Corleone. There was no 
one else she cared to see. Slyly she whispered in Connie’s 
ear, ‘Only a few hours more and you’ll Imow what it’s all 
about.’ Connie giggled. Lucy demurely folded her hands on 
the table, treacherously triumphant, as if she had stolen a 
treasure from the bride. 

Amerigo Bonasera followed Hagen into the comer room.of 
the house and found Don Corleone sitting behind a huge desk. 
Sonny Corleone was standing by the window, lool^g out 
into the garden. For the first time that afternoon the Don 
behaved coolly. He did not embrace the visitor or shake 
hands. The sallow-faced undertaker owed his invitation to the 
fact that his wife and the wife of the Don were the closest of 
friends. Amerigo Bonasera himself was in severe disfavour 
with Don Corleone. 

Bonasera began his request obliquely and cleverly. ‘You 
must excuse my daughter, your wife’s goddaughter, for not 
doing your family the respect of coming today. She is in the 
hospital still.’ He glanced at Sonny Corleone^ and Tom 
Hagen to indicate that he did not wish to speak brforc them. 
But the Don was merciless. 

‘We all know of your daughter’s misfortune,’ Don Corleone 
said. ‘If I can help her in any way, you have only to speak. My 
wife is her godmother after all. 1 have never forgotten that 
honour.’ This was a rebuke. The undertaker never called Don 
Corleone ‘Godfather’ as custom dictated. 

Bonasera, ashen-fitced, asked, directly now, ‘May I speak to 
you alone?’ 


*7 



Don Corleone shook his head, *1 trust these two men with 
my life. They are my two tight arms. 1 cannot insult them by 
sending them away.’ 

The undertaker closed his eyes for a moment and then 
began to speak. His voice was quiet, the voice he used to con- 
sole the bereaved. raised my daughter in the American 
fashion. I believe in America. America has made my fortune. 
I gave my daughter her freedom and yet taught her never to 
dishonour her family. She found a “boyfriend”, not an 
Italian. She went to the movies with him. She stayed out late. 
But he never came to meet her parents. I accepted all this 
without a protest, the fault is mine. Two months ago he took 
her for a drive. He had a masculine friend with him. They 
made her drink whisky and then they tried to take advantage 
of her. She resisted. She kept her honour. They beat her. Like 
an animal. When I went to the hospital she had two black 
eyes. Her nose was broken. Her jaw was shattered. They had 
to wire it together. She wept through her pain. “Father, 
Father, why did they do it? Why did they do this to me?” 
And I wept.’ Bonasera could not speak further, he was weep- 
ing now though his voice had not betrayed his emotion. 

Den Corleone, as if against his will, made a gesture of 
sympathy and Bonasera went on, his voice human with 
suffering. ‘Why did I weep? She was the light of my life, an 
affectionate daughter. A beautiful girl. She tmsted people and 
now she will never trust them again. She will never be 
beautiful again.’ He was trembling, his sallow face flushed an 
ugly dark red. 

‘I went to the police like a good American. The two boys 
were arrested. They were brought to trial. The evidence was 
overwhelming and they pleaded guilty. The judge sentenced 
them to three years in prison and suspended the sentence. 
They went free that very day. I stood in the courtroom like a 
fool and those bastards smiled at me. And then 1 said to my 
wife: “We must go to Don Corleone for justice.’” 

Tlie Don had bowed his head to show respect for the man’s 
grief. But when he spdke, the words were cold with offended 
^gnity. ‘Why did you go to the police? Why didn’t you come 
to me at the beginning of this a£^?’ 

2S 



Bonasera muttered almost inaudibly, * What do you want of 
me? Tell me what you wish. But do what I beg you to do.* 
There was something almost insolent in his words, 

Don Corleonc said gravely, ‘And what is that?’ 

Bonasera glanced at Hagen and Sonny Corlcone and shook 
his head. The Don, still sitting at Hagen’s desk, inclined his 
body towards the undertaker. Bonasera hesitated, then bent 
down and put his lips so close to the Don’s hairy ear that they 
touched. Don Corlcone listened like a priest in the confes- 
sional, gazing away into the distance, impassive, remote. 
They stood so for a long moment until Bonasera finished 
whispering and straightened to his full height. The Don 
looked up gravely at Bonasera. Bonasera, his face Hushed, 
returned the stare unflinchingly. 

Finally the Don spoke. ‘That I cannot do. You are being 
carried away.’ 

Bonasera said loudly, clearly, ‘I will pay you anything you 
ask.* On hearing this, Hagen Hinched, a nervous flick of his 
head. Sonny Corlcone folded his arms, smiled sardonically as 
he turned from the window to watch the scene in the room for 
the first time. 

Don Corleone rose from behind the desk. His face was still 
impassive, but his voice rang like cold death. ‘ We have known 
each other many years, you and I,’ he said to the undertaker, 
‘but until this day you never came to me for coimsel or help. I 
can’t remember the last time you invited me to your house for 
coffee, though my wife is godmother to your only child. Let 
us be frank. You spurned my friendship. You feared to be in 
my debt.’ 

Bonasera murmured, ‘Ldidn’t want to get into trouble.* 

The Don held up his hand. ‘No. Don’t speak. You found 
America a paradise. You had a good trade, you made a good 
living, you thought the world a harmless place where you 
could take your pleasure as you willed. You never armed 
yourself with true friends. After all, the police guarded you, 
there were courts of law, you and yours could come to no 
harm. You did not need Don Corleone. Very well. My feelings 
were wounded, but I am not that sort of person who thrusts 
his friendship on those who do not value it - on those who 


*9 



thinlr me of little account/ The Don paused and gave the 
undertaker a polite, ironic smile. *Now you come to me and 
say, *^Don Corleone give me justice/* And you do not ask 
widi respect. You do not offer me your friendship. You come 
into my home on the bridal day of my daughter and you ask 
me to do murder and you say’ * here the Don’s voice became 
a scornful mimicry - will pay you anything/’ No, no, I 
am not offended, but what have I ever done to make you treat 
me so disrespectfully?’ 

Bonasera eded out in his anguish and his fear, 'America has 
been good to me. I wanted to be a good citizen. I wanted my 
child to be American.* 

The Don clapped his hands together with decisive approval. 
'Well spoken. Very fine. Then you have nothing to complain 
about. The judge has ruled. America has ruled. Bring your 
daughter flowers and a box of candy when you go visit her in 
the hospital. That will comfort her. Be content. After all, this 
is not a serious aflair, the boys were young, high-spirited, and 
one of them is the son of a powerful politician. No, my dear 
Amerigo, you have slwzys b^ honest. 1 must admit, though 
^ou spurned my friendship, that I would trust the given word 
of Amerigo Bonasera more than 1 would any other man’s. 
So give me your word that you will put aside this madness. 
It is not American. Forgive. Forget, life is full of mis- 
fortunes.’ 

The cruel and contemptuous irony with which all this was 
said, the controlled anger of the Don, reduced the poor under- 
taker to a quiveiing jelly, but he spoke up bravdy again. 'I 
ask you for justice.’ 

Don Corleone said curtly, 'The court gave you justice.* 

Bonasera 'Shook his head stubbornly. 'No. They gave the 
youths justice. They did not give me justice.* 

The Don acknowledged this fine dbtinedon with an 
approving nod, jdien ask^, 'What is your justice?’ 

'An eye for an eye,' Bonasera said. 

'You asked for more,* the Don said. 'Your daughter is 
alive.’ 

Bonasera said reluctantly, 'Let diem sufler as she suffers.* 
The Don waited for him to speak farther. Bonasera screwed 



up the last of his coufage and said, ^How much shall 1 pay 
you?’ It was a despairing wail. 

Don Corleone turned his back. It was a dismissal. Bonasera 
did not budge. 

Finally, sighing, a good-hearted man who cannot remain 
angry with an erring friend, Don Corleone turned back to the 
undertaker, who was now as pale as one of his corpses. Don 
Corleone was gentle, patient. ‘Why do you feat to give your 
first allegiance to me?’ he said. ‘You go to the law courts and 
wait for months. You spend money on lawyers who know full 
well you are to be made a fool of. You accept judgement from 
a judge whO' sells himself like the worst whore in the streets. 
Years gone by, when you needed money, you went to the 
banks and paid ruinous interest, waited hat in hand like a 
beggar while they sniffed aroimd, poked their noses up your 
very asshole to make sure you could pay them back.* The Don 
paused, his voice became sterner. 

‘But if you had come to me, my purse would have bec^ 
yours. If you had come to me for justice those scum who 
ruined your daughter would be weeping bitter tears this day. 
If by some misfortune an honest man like yourself made 
enemies they would become my enemies ’ - the Don raised his 
arm, finger pointing at Bonasera - ‘and then, believe me, they 
would fear you.’ 

Bonasera bowed his head and murmured in a strangled 
voice, ‘Be my friend. I accept.’ 

Don Corleone put his hand on the man’s shoulder. ‘Good,’ 
he said, ‘you shall have your justice. Some day, and that day 
may never come, 1 will call upon you to do me a service in 
return. Until that day, consider this justice a gift from my wife, 
your daughter’s godmother.’ 

When the door closed behind the grateful undertaker Don 
Corleone turned to Hagen and said, ‘Give this affair to 
Qemenza and tell him to be sure to use reliable people, people 
who will not be carried away by the smell of blood. After all, 
we’re not murderers, no matter what that corpse valet dreams 
up in his foolish head.* He noted that his first-bom, masculine 
son was gaaing through the window at the garden party. It 
was bopdess, Don Corleone thought. If he refused to be 



instructed, Santino could never run the family business, could 
never become 'a Don. He would have to find somebody else. 
And soon. After all, he was not immortal. 

From the garden, startling all three men, there came a happy 
roaring shout. Sonny Corleone pressed dose to the window. 
What he saw made him move quickly towards the door, a 
delighted smile on his face. *It’s Johnny, he came to the 
wedding, what did I tell you?* Hagen moved to the window, 
‘It’s really your godson,’ he said to Don CorlTOne. ‘Shall I 
bring him here?’ 

‘No,’ the Don said. ‘Let the people enjoy him. Let him 
come to me when he is ready.’ He smiled at Hagen. ‘You sec? 
He is a good godson.’ 

Hagen felt a twinge of jealousy. He said dryly, ‘It’s been 
twoyears. He’s probablyin trouble again and wants you to help.* 

‘And who should he come to if not his godfadier?’ asked 
Don Cotleone. 

The first one to see Johnny Fontaoe enter the garden was 
Connie Corleune. She forgot her bridal dignity and screamed, 
‘Johnece’. Then she ran into his arms. He hugged her tight 
and kissed her on the mouth, kept his arm around her as 
others came up to greet him. They were all ^s old friends, 
people he had grown up with on the West Side. Then Connie 
was dragging him to her new husband. Johnny saw with 
amusement that the blond young man looked a little sour at no 
longer being the star of the day. He turned on all his charm, 
shaking the groom’s hand, toasting him with a glass of wine. 

A familiar voice called from the bandstand, ‘How about 
giving us a song, Johnny?’ He looked up and saw Nino 
Valenti smiling down at him. Johnny Fontane jumped up on 
the bandstand and threw his arms around Nino. They had 
been inseparable, singing together, going out with girls 
together, until Johnny had started to become famous and 
sing on the radio. When he had gone to Hollywood to make 
movies Johnny had phoned Nino a couple of times just to talk 
and had promised to get him a club singing date. But he had 
never done so. Seeing Nino now, his cheerful, mocking, 
drunken grin, all the a&ction retumed.

Kino began stnunming on the mandolin. Johnny Fontane 
put his hand on Nino’s shoulder. ^This is for the btidc»’ he 
said, and stamping his foot, chanted the words to an obscene 
Sicilian love song. As he sang, Nino made suggestive motions 
with his body. The bride blushed proudly, the throng of 
guests roared its approval. Before the song ended they were 
ali stamping with their feet and roaring out the sly, double- 
meaning tag line that finished each stamca. At the end they 
would not stop applauding until Johnny cleared his throat to 
sing another song. 

They were all proud of him. He was of them and he had 
become a famous singer, a movie star who slept with the most 
desired women in the world. And yet he had shown proper 
respect for his Godfather by travelling three thousand ci^es to 
attend diis wedding. He still loved old friends like Nino 
Valenti. Many of the people there had seen Johrmy and Nino 
singing together when they were just boys, when no one 
dreamed that Johnny Fontane would grow up to hold the 
hearts of fifty million women in his hands. 

Johnny Fontane reached down and lifted the bride up on to 
the bandstand so that Connie stood between him and Nino. 
Both men crouched down, facing each other, Nino plucking 
the mandolin for a few harsh chords. It was an old routine of 
theirs, a mock battle and wooing, using their voices like 
swords, each shouting a chorus in turn. With the most delicate 
courtesy. Johnny let Nino’s voice overwhelm his own, let 
Nino take the bride from his arm, let Nino swing into the last 
victorious stanza while his own voice died away. The whole 
wedding party hrokeioto shouts of applause,the three of them em- 
braced each other at the end. The guests begged for another song. 

Only Don Corleone, standing in the corner entrance of the 
house, sensed something amiss. Cheerily, with bluff good 
humour, careful not to give ofience to his guests, he called 
out, ^My godson has come three thousand miles to do us 
honour and no one thinks to wet his throat?’ At once a dozen 
full wine glasses were thrust at Johnny Fontane. He took a sip 
from all and rushed to embrace his Godfisther. As he did so he 
whispered something into the older man’s ear. Don Corleone 
led hto into the house. 



Tom Hagca hdd out his band when Johnny came into the 
room. Johnny shook it and said, *How ate you, Tom?* But 
without his usual charm that consisted of a genuine warmth 
for people. Hagen was a litde hurt by this coolness, but 
shrugged it off. It was one of the penalties for being the Don’s 
hatchet man. 

Johnny Fontane said to the Don, * When 1 got the wedding 
invitation I said to myself, ^'My Godfather isn’t mad at me 
any more.” I called you five times after my divorce and Tom 
always told me you were out or busy, so I knew you were 
sore.’ 

Don Corleone was filling glasses from the yellow bottle of 
Strega. ^That’a all forgotten. Now. Can I do something for 
you still? You’re not too fismous, too rich, that 1 can’t help 
you?’ 

Johnny gulped down the yellow fiery liquid and held out his 
glass to be refilled. He tried to sound jaunty. *I’m not rich. 
Godfather. I’m going down. You were right. I should never 
have left my wife and kids for that tramp 1 married. 1 don’t 
blame you for gctdng sore at me.’ 

The Don shrugged. '1 worded about you, you’re my 
godson, that’s all.’ 

Johnny paced up and down the room. was crazy about 
that bitch. The biggest star in HoUywood. She looks like an 
angel. And you know what she does after a picture? If the 
make-up man does a good job on her face she lets him bang 
her. If the cameraman made her look extra good she brings 
him into her dressing room and gives him a screw. Anybody. 
She uses her body like 1 use the loose change m my pocket for 
a dp. A whore made for the devil.’ 

Don' Corleone curtly broke in. *How is your family?’ 

Johnny sighed. took care of them. After the divorce 1 
gave Ginny and the kids more than the courts said I should. 1 
go see them once a week. 1 miss them. Sometimes I think I’m 
going crazy.’ He took another drink. !Now my second wife 
laughs at me. She can’t understand my being jealous. She calls 
me an old-fashioned guinea, she makes fi^ of my singing. 
Before 1 left I gave ^ a beating, but not in the fiioe 
because she was making a picture. I gave her ciamps, 1 


54 



punched her on the arms and legs like a kid and she kept 
laughing at me.* He lit a cigarette. * So, Godfather, right now, 
life doe8n*t seem worth living.* 

Don Corleone said simply, ^These are troubles 1 can’t help 
you with.* He paused, then asked, ’What’s the matter ^trith 
your voice?* 

All the assured charm, the self-mockery, disappeared from 
Johnny Fontane’s face. He said almost brokenly, ’God&ther, 
I can’t sing any more, something happened to my throat, the^ 
doctors don’t know what.* Hagen and the Don leaked at him 
with surprise, Johnny had always been so tough. Fontane went 
on. ’My two pictures made a lot of money. I was a big star. 
Now they throw me out. The head of the studio always hated 
my guts, and now he’s paying mt off.* 

Don Corleone s^pod b^re his godson and asked grimly, 
’Why doesn’t this man like you?’ 

’I used to sing those songs for the liberal organkadons, you 
know, all that stuff you never liked me to do. Well, jiudk 
Waltz didn’t like it either. He called me a Communist, but he 
couldn’t make it sddr. Then I snatched a gkl he had saved for 
himself. It was stdedy a one-night stand and she came after 
me. What the hell could 1 do? Then my whore second wife 
throws me out. And Ginny and the kids won’t take me back 
unless 1 come ctawUng on my hands and knees, and I can’t 
sing any mote. God&ther, what the hell can 1 do?’ 

Don Gorleone’s fece had become cold without a hint of 
sympathy. He said contemptuously, ’You can start by acting 
like a man.’ Suddenly anger contorted his fece. He shouted. 
’LtKB A manI’ He reached over the desk and grabbed Johnny 
Fontane by the hair of his head in a gesture that was savagely 
affectionate. ’By Christ in heaven, is it possible that you spent 
so much time in presence and tuti^ out no better than 
this? A Holl 3 rwood finoetUo who weeps and begs for pity? 
Who cries out like a woman - ”Wbat shall I do? Oh, what 
shall I do?”’ 

The mimkxy of the Don was so extraordinary, so unex- 
pected, diat Hagen and Johnny were startled into laughter. 
Don Corleone was plea^. For a moment he reflected on 
how mudi he loved this godson. How would his own three 



sons have reacted to such a tongue-lashing? Sandno would 
have sulked and behaved badly for weeks afterwards. Fredo 
would have been cowed. Michael would have given him a cold 
smile and gone out of the house, not to be seen for months. 
But Johnny, ah, what a £ne chap he was, stniHng now, 
gathering strength, knowing already the true purpose of his 
Godfather. 

Don Corleone went on. ‘You took the woman of your boss, 
a man more powerful than yourself, then you complain he 
won’t help you. What nonsense. You left your family, your 
children without a fatlicr, to marry a whore and you weep 
because they don’t welcome you back with open arms. The 
whore, you don’t hit her in the face because she is making a 
picture, then you are ainaaed because she laughs at you. You 
lived Like a fool and you have come to a fool’s end.* 

Don Corleone paused to ask in a patient voice, ‘Are you 
willing to take my advice this time?’ 

Johnny Fontane shrugged. ‘I can’t marry Ginny again, not 
the way she wants. I have to gamble, 1 have to drink, I have to 
go out with the boys. Beautiful broads run after me and 1 
never could resist them. Then I used to feel like a heel when I 
went back to Ginny. Christ, 1 can’t go through all that crap 
again.’ 

It was rare that Don Corleone showed exasperation. ‘I 
didn’t tell you to get married again. Do what you want. It’s 
good you wish to be a ftther to your children. A man who is 
not a fttlicr to his children can never be a real man. But then, 
you must make their mother accept you. Who says you can’t 
see them every day? Who says you can’t live in the same 
house? Who says you can’t live your life exactly as you want to 
live it?* 

Johnny Fontane laughed. ‘Godfather, not all women arc 
like the old Italian wives. Ginny won’t stand for it.’ 

Now the Don was mocking. ‘Because you acted like a 
fifwcMe, You gave her more than the court said. You didn’t hit 
the other in the fice because she was making a picture. You 
let women dictate your actions and they are not competent in 
this world, though certainly they will be saints in heaven while 
we men bum in hell. And then I’ve watched you all these 



years.’ The Don’s voice bec^e earnest. * You’ve been a fine 
godson, you’ve given me all the respect. But what of your 
other old friends? One year you run around with this person, 
the next year with another person. That Italian boy who was so 
funny in the movies, he had some bad luck and you never saw 
him again because you were more famous. And how about 
your old, old comrade that you went to sdiool with, who was 
your partner singing? Nino. He drinks too much out of dis- 
appointment, but he never complains. He works hard driving 
the gravel truck and sings weekends for a few JoUars. He 
never says anything against you. You couldn’t help him a bit? 
Why not? He sings well.’ 

Johnny Fontane said with patient weariness, ‘Godfather, he 
just hasn’t got enough talent. He’s OK, but he’s not big 
time.’ 

Don Corlepne lidded his eyes almost closed and then said, 
‘And you, godson, you now, you just don’t have talent 
enough. ShaitI get you a job on the gravel truck with Nino?’ 
When Johnny didn’t answer, the Don went on. ‘Friendship is 
everything. Friendship is more than talent. It is mote than 
government. It is almost the equal of family. Never forget 
that. If you had built up a wall of friendships you wouldn’t 
have to ask me to help. Now tell me, why can’t you sing? You 
sang well in the garden. As well as Nino.’ 

Hagen and Johnny smiled at this delicate thrust. It was 
Johnny’s turn to be patronizingiy patient. ‘My voice is weak. 
I sing one or two songs and then I can’t sing again for hours or 
days. I can’t make it ^ough the rehearsals or the retakes. My 
voice is weak, it’s got some sort of sickdess.’ 

‘So you have woman trouble. Your voice is sick. Now tell 
me the trouble you’re having with this HoMj^ood 
who won’t let you work.’ The Don was getting down to 
business. 

‘He’s bigger than one of yom pei(;(pnopa 9 ti* Johnny said. 
‘He owns tibe studio. He advises the President on movie 
propaganda for the war. Just a month ago he bought the 
movie rights to the biggest novel of the year. A bestseller. 
And the main character is a guy just like me. 1 wouldn’t even 
have to act, just be myself. 1 w^dn’t even have to sing. 1 


57 



might even win the Academy Award. Everybody knows' it's 
p^ect for me and I^d be big again. As an actor. But that 
bastard Jack Wolta is paying me off, he won^t give it to me. 1 
ofiered to do it for nothing, for a minimi iin ptice onH be 
says no. He sent the word t^t if I come and kiss his ass in the 
studio commissary, maybe he’ll think about it.’ 

Don Corleone dismissed this emotional nonsense with a 
wave of his hand. Among reasonable men problems of 
business could always be solved. He patted his godson on the 
shoulder. * You’re discouraged. Nobody cares about you, so 
you think. And you’ve lost a lot of weight. You drink a lot, 
eh? You don’t sleep and you take pills?’ He shook his head 
disapprovingly. 

‘ Now I want you to follow my orders,’- the Don said. *I want 
you to stay in my house for one month. I want you to eat well, 
to^rest and sleep. I want you to be my companion, I enjoy 
your company, and maybe you can learn something about the 
world from your Godfather that might even help you in the 
great Hollywood. But no singing, no drinking, and no 
women. At the end of the month you can go back to Holly- 
wood and this calibre will give you that 

job you want. Done?’ 

Johnny Fontane could not altogether believe that the Don 
had such power. But his Godfather had never said such and 
such a thing could be done without having it done. ’This guy 
is a persond friend of J. Edgar Hoover,’ Johnny said. ^You 
can’t even raise your voice to him.’ 

‘He’s a businessman,’ the Don said blandly. ‘I’ll make him 
an offer he can’t refuse.’ 

‘It’s too late,’ Johnny said. ‘All the contracts have been 
signed^ and they start shooting in a week. It’s absolutely im- 
possible.’ 

Don Corleone said, ‘Go, go back to the party. Your friends 
are waiting for you. Leave everything to me.’ He pushed 
Johnny Fontane out of the room. 

Hagen sat behind the desk and made notes. The Don heaved 
a sigh and asked, ‘Is there anything else?’ 

‘Sollozzo can’t be put off any mote. You’U have to see him 
this week.’ Hagen held his pen over die calendar. 

58 



The Don shragged. *Now that the wedding k over* when- 
ever you like.’ 

This answer told Hagen two things. Most important, that 
the answer to Virgil Sollozao would be no. The second, that 
Don Corleone, since he would not give the answer before his 
daughter’s wedding, expected his no to cause trouble. 

Hagen said cautiously, * Shall 1 tell Qemen^a to have some 
men come live in the house?’ 

The Don said impatiently, ^For what? 1 didn’t answer 
before the wedding because on an important day like that 
there should be no cloud, not even in the distance. Also 1 
wanted to know beforehand what he wanted to talk about. 
We know now. What he will propose is an infamita* 

Hagen asked, ‘Then you will refuse?’ When the Don 
nodded, Hagen said, ‘I think we should all discuss it - die 
whole Family - before you give your answer.’ 

The Don smiled. ‘You think so? Good, we will discuss it. 
When you come back from Gdifomia. 1 want you to fly diere 
tomorrow and settle this business for Johnny. See that movie 
Tell S 0 II 0220 1 will see him when you get badt 
from California. Is there anything else?’ 

Hagen said formally, ‘The hospital called. 
Abbandando is dying, he won’t last out the night. His fiunily 
was told to come and wait.’ 

Hagen had filled the ConstgliotrV% post for the past year, ever 
since the cancer had imprisoned Genco Abbandando in his 
hospital bed. Now be waited to hear Don Corleone say the 
post was his permanently. The odds were against it. So high a 
position was traditionally given only to a man descended from 
two Italian parents. There had alre^y been trouble about his 
temporary performance of the duties. Also, lie was cmly 
thirty-five, not old enough, ^pposedly, to have acquired the 
necessary experience and cunning for a successful Oms^fiori. 

But the Don gave him no encouragement. He asked, ‘When 
does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?’ 

Hagen looked at his wristwatch. ‘In a few minutes tiieyHl 
cut ^ cake and then a harbour after that.’ That reminded 
him of something else. ‘Your new son-in-law. Do we give 
him something important, inside die Family?’ 



He was surprised at the vehemence of the Don^s answer. 
‘Never.* The Don hit the desk with the flat of his hand. 
‘Never. Give him something to earn his living, a good 
living. But never let him know the Family’s business. Tdl the 
others. Sonny, Frcdo, Qemen:sa.’ 

The Don paused. * Instruct my sons, all three of them, that 
they will accompany me to the hospit^ to see poor Genco. I 
want them to pay their last respects. Tell Freddie to drive the 
big car and ask Johnny if he will come with us, as a special 
favour to me.’ He saw Hagen look at him questioningly. ‘I 
want you to go to Califomia tonight. You won’t have time to 
go see Genco. But don’t leave until I come back from the 
hospital and speak with you. Under's tood ? * 

‘ Understood,’ Hagen said. * What time should Fred have the 
car waiting?’ 

* When the guests have left/ Don Corleone said. ‘Genco will 
wait for me.’ 

‘The Senator called,’ Hagen said. ‘Apologizing for not 
coming personally but that you would understand. He 
probably means these two FBI men across the street taking 
down licence numbers. But he sent his gift over by special 
messenger.’ 

The Don nodded. He did not think it necessary to mention 
that he himself had warned the Senator not to come. ‘Did he 
send a nice present?’ 

Hagen made a face of impressed approval that was very 
strangely Italian on his German-Irish features. ‘Antique 
silver, very valuable. The kids can sell it for a grand at least. 
The Senator spent a lot of time getting exactly the right thing. 
For those kind of people that’s more important than how 
much it costs.’ 

Don Corleohe did not hide his pleasure that so great a man 
as the Senator had shown him such respect. The Senator, like 
Luca Brasi, was one of the great stones in the Don's power 
structure, and he too, with this gift, had reswom his 
loyalty. 

When Johnny Fontane appeared in the garden Kay Adams 
recognized him immediately. She was truly surprise. ‘You 


40 



never told me your fimiily knew Johnny Fontane,’ she said. 
‘Now I’m sure I’ll marry you.’ 

‘Do you want to meet him?* Michael asked. 

‘Not now/ Kay said. She sighed. ‘I was in love with him 
for three years. I used lo come down to New York whenever 
he sang at the Capitol and scream my head o£F. He was so 
wonderful.* 

‘We’ll meet him later/ Michael said. 

When Johnny finished singing and vanished into the house 
with Don Corlcone, Kay said archly to Michael, ‘Don’t tell 
me a big movie star like Johnny Fontane has to ask your 
father for a favour?’ 

‘He’s my father’s godson/ Michael said. ‘And if it wasn’t 
for my father he might not be a big movie star today.’ 

Kay Adams laughed with delight. ‘That sounds like another 
great story.’ 

Michael shook his head. ‘I can’t teU that one/ he said. 

‘Trust me,’ she said. 

He told her. He told her without being funny. He told it 
without pride. He told it without any sort of explanation 
except that eight years before his father had been more 
impetuous, and because the matter concerned his godson, 
the Don considered it an afiair of personal honour. 

The story was quickly told. Eight years ago Johnny Fontane 
had made an extraordinary success singing with a popular 
dance band. He had become a top radio attraction. Unfor- 
tunately the band leader, a well-known show business per- 
sonality named Les Halley, had signed Johnny to a five-year 
persoi^ services contract. It was a common show-business 
practice. Les Halley could now loan Johnny out and pocket 
most of the money. 

Don Codeone entered the negotiations personally. He 
ofiered Les Halley twenty thousand dollars to release Johnny 
Fontane horn the personal services contract. Halley o^ered to 
take only fifty per cent of Johnny’s earnings. Don Corlcone 
was amused. He dropped his offer from twenty thousand 
doUars to ten thousand dollars. The band leader, obviously 
not a man of the world outside his beloved show business, com- 
tdetely missed the -significance of this lower ofier. He rdfused. 


41 



The next day Don Cotleone went to see the band leader 
personally. He brought with him his two best friends, 
Genco Abbandando, who was his Consigliori^ and Luca Brasi. 
With no other witnesses Don Corleone persuaded Les Halley 
to sign a document giving up all rights to all services from 
Johnny Fontane upon payment of a certified cheque to the 
amount of ten thousand dollars. Don Corleone did this by 
putting a pistol to the forehead of the band leader and assuring 
him with the utmost seriousness that either his signature or his 
brains would rest on that document in exactly one minute. 
Les Halley signed. Don Corleone pocketed his pistol and 
handed over the certified cheque. 

The rest was history. Johnny Fontane went on to become 
the greatest singing sensation in the country. He made Holly- 
wood musicals that earned a fortune for his studio. His 
records made millions of dollars. Then he divorced his child- 
hood-sweetheart wife and lefr his two children, to marry the 
most glamorous blonde star in motion pictures. He soon 
learned that she was a ‘whore*. He drank, he gambled, he 
chased other women. He lost his singing voice. His records 
stopped selling. The studio did not renew his contract. And 
so now he had come back to his Godfrther. 

Kay said thoughtfully, ‘Are you sure you’re not jealous of 
your father? Everything you’ve told me about him shows him 
doing something for other people. He must be good-hearted.’ 
She smiled wryly. ‘Of course his methods are not exactly 
constitutional.’ 

Michael sighed. *I guess that’s the way it sounds, but let me 
tell you this. You Imow those Arctic explorers who leave 
caches of food scattered on the route to the North Pole? 
Just in case they may need diem some day? That’s my 
father’s frvours. Some day he’ll be at each one of those 
people’s houses and diey had better come across.’ 

It was nearly twilight before the wedding cake was shown, 
exclaimed over, and eaten. Specially baked by Nazorine, it was 
deverly decorated with shells of cream so dizzyingly ddidous 
diat die bdde greedily plucked them from the corpse of the 
cake befi^re she whiwied away on her honeymoon with her 
blond groom. The Don policy sped his* guests’ dqsartore. 


4 * 



nodng meanwhile that the black sedan with its FBI men was 
no longer visible. 

Finally, the only car left in the driveway was the long black 
Cadillac with Freddie at the wheeL^The Don got into the front 
seat, moving with quick coordination for his age and bulk. 
Sonny, Michael, and Johnny Fontane got into the back seat. 
Don Corleone said to his son Michael, ‘Your girlfriend, she’ll 
get back to the city by herself all right?’ 

Michael nodded. ‘Tom said he’d take care of it.’ Don 
(^rleone nodded with satisfaction at Hagen’s efficiency. 

Because of the gas rationing still in efiect, there was little 
traffic on the Belt Parkway to Manhattan. In less than an hour 
the Cadillac rolled into the street of French Hospital. During 
the ride Don Corleone asked his youngest son if he was doing 
well in school. Michael nodded. Then Sonny in the back scat 
asked his father, ‘Johnny says you’re getting him squared 
away with that Hollywood business. Do you want me to go 
out there and help?’ 

Don Corleone was curt. ‘Tom is going tonight. He won’t 
need any help, it’s a simple aftiir.’ 

Sonny Corleone laughed. ‘Johnny thinks you can’t fix it, 
that’s why 1 thought you might want me to go out there.’ 

Don Corleone turned his head. ‘Why do you doubt me?’ he 
asked Johnny Fontane. ‘Hasn’t your Godfrther always done 
what he said he would do? Have 1 ever been taken for afool?’ 

Johnny apologized nervously. ‘Godfather, the man who 
runs it is a .90 calibre pa^nmf€mt 9 . You can’t budge him, 

not even with money. He has big connexions. And he hates 
me. 1 just don’t know how you can swing it.’ 

The Don spoke with affectionate amusement. ‘1 say to you: 
you shall have it.’ He nudged Michael with his elbow. ‘We 
won’t disappoint my godson, eh, Michael?’ 

Michael, who never doubted his &ther for a moment, shook 
his head. 

As they walked towards the hospital entrance, Don Cor- 
leone put his hand on Michael’s arm so that the o^ers forged 
ahead. ‘When you get through with college, come and talk to 
me,’ the Don said. ‘1 have some plans you will like.’ 

Michael didn’t say anything. Don Corleone grunted in 


45 



exasperation. know how you ate. 1 won’t ask you to do 
anything you don’t approve of. This is something special. Go 
your own way now, you’re a man after all. But come to me as a 
son should when you have finished with your schooling.’ 

The family of Gcnco Abbandando, wife and three daughters 
dressed in black, clustered like a flock of plump crows on the 
white tile floor of tlie hospital corridor. When they saw Don 
Corleone come out of the elevatoi they seemed to flutter up 
off the white tiles in an instinctive surge towards him for 
protection. The mother was regally stout in black, the 
daughters fat and plain. Mrs Abbandando pecked at Don 
Corleone’s cheek, sobbing, wailing, ‘ Oh, what a saint you arc, 
to come here on your daughter’s wedding day.* 

Don Corleone brushed these thanks aside. ‘Don’t I owe 
respect to such a friend, a friend who has been my right arm 
for twenty years?’ He had understood immediately that the 
soon-to-be widow did not comprehend that her husband 
would die this night. Genco Abbandando had been in this 
hospital for nearly a year dying of his cancer and the wife had 
come to consider his fatal illness almost an ordinary part of 
life. Tonight was just another crisis. She babbled on. ‘Go in 
and see my poor husband,’ she said, ‘he asks for you. Poor, 
man, he wanted to come to the wedding to show his respect, 
but the doctor would not permit it. Then he said you would 
come to see him on this great day, but I did not believe it 
possible. Ah, men understand friendship more than we 
women. Go inside, you will make him happy.’ 

A nurse and a doctor came out of Genco Abbandando’s 
private room. The doctor was a young man, serious-faced and 
with the air of one born to command, that is to say, the air of 
one who has been immensely rich all his life. One of the 
daughters asked timidly, ‘ Dr Kennedy, can we go to see him 
now?’ 

Dr Kennedy looked over the large group with exasperation. 
Didn’t these people rcalixe that the man inside was dying 
and dying in torturous pain? It would be much better if every- 
one let him die in peace. ‘I think just the immediate family/ 
he said in his exquisitely polite voice. He was surprised 



when the wife and daughters turned to the short, heavy man 
dressed in an awkwardly £tted tuxedo, as if to hear his 
decision. * 

The heavy man spoke. There was just the slightest trace of 
an Italian accent in his voice. "My dear doaor,’ said Don 
Corleone, " is it true he is dying? ’ 

"Yes/ said Dt Kennedy. 

"Then there is nothing more for you to do/ said Don 
Corleone. "We will take up the burden. We wiD comfort him. 
We will dose his eyes. We will bury him and weep at his 
funeral and afterwards we will watch over his wife and 
daughters.’ At hearing things put so bluntly, forcing her to 
understand, Mrs Abbandando ^gan to weep. 

Dr Kennedy shrugged. It was impossible to explain to these 
peasants. At the same time he recognized the crude justice in 
the man’s remarks. His role was over. Still exquisitely polite, 
he said, "Please wait for the nurse to let you in, she has a few 
necessary things to do with the patient.’ He walked away from 
them down the corridor, his white coat flapping. 

The nurse went back into the room and they waited. Finally 
she came out again, holding the door for them to enter. She 
whispered, ‘He’s delirious with the pain and fever, try not to 
exdte him. And you can stay only a few minutes, except for the 
wife.’ She recognized Johnny Fontane as he went by her and 
her eyes opened wide. He gave her a faint smile of acknow- 
ledgement and she stared at him with frank invitation. He fled 
her away for future reference, then followed the others into 
the sick man’s room. 

Genco Abbandando had run a long race with death, and 
now, vanquished, he lay exhausted on the raised bed. He was 
wasted away to no more than a skdeton, and what had once 
been vigorous black hair had turned into obscene stringy 
wisps. Don Corleone said cheerily, "Genco, dear friend, I have 
brought my sons to pay their respects, and look, even Johnny 
all the way from Hollywood.’ 

The dying man raised his fevered eyes gratefully to the Don. 
He let the young men clasp his bony hand in their fleshy ones. 
His wife and daughters ranged themsdves along his bed, 
kissing his cheek, taking his other hand in turn. 


45 



The Don pressed his old fidend’s hincL He said comfort- 
ingly, *Hurry up and get better and well take a trip to Italy 
tog^et to our old village. We’ll play bom$ in frcmt of the 
wineshop like our fiithets before us.’ 

The dying man shook his head, fie motioned the young 
men and his fiunily away from his bedside; widi the other 
bony daw he hung fast to the Don. He tri^ to speak. The 
Don put his head down and then sat on the bedside chair. 
Genco Abbandando was babbling about their childhood. 
Then his coal-black eyes became sly. He whispered. The Don 
bent doser. The others in the room were astonished to see 
tears running down Don Corleone’s free as he shook his head. 
The quavering voice grew louder, filling the room. With a 
tortured, superhuman effort, Abbandando lifted his head off 
his pillow, eyes unseeing, and pointed a skeletal forefinger at 
the Don. ^Godfather, Godfather,’ he called out blindly, ’save 
me from death, 1 beg of you. I^y flesh is burning off my bones 
and 1 can fed the worms eating away my brain. Godfrther, 
cure me, you have the power, dry the tears of my poor wife. 
In Corleone we played together as children, and now wiU you 
let me die when 1 fear hell for my sins?’ 

The Don was silent. Abbandando said, ’It is your daughter’s 
wedding day, you cannot refuse me.’ 

The Don spoke quietly, gravdy, to pierce through the 
blasphemous delirium. ’Old friend,’ he said, ’1 have no such 
powers. If I did I would be more merciful than God, believe 
me. But don’t fear death and don’t fear hell. I will have a mass 
said for your soul every night and every morning. Your wife 
and your children will pray for you. How can God punish you 
with so many pleas for mercy?’ 

The skeleton face took on a cunning expression that was 
obscene. Abbandando said slyly, 'It’s been arranged then?’ 

When the Don answered, his voice was cold, without 
comfort. ’You blaspheme. Resign yourself.’ 

Abbandando fell back on the pillow. His eyes lost their wild 
gleam of hope. The nurse came back into the room and started 
shooing them out in a very matter-of-fret way. The Don got 
up, but Abbandando put out his hand. ’GoeflEsther,’ he said, 
’stay here with me and help me meet death. Perhaps if He sees 

46 



you neair me He vnU be filghteiied and leave me in peace. Or 
perhaps you can say a word, puU a few strings, eh?* The 
dying man winked as if he were mocking the Don, now not 
really serious. ^You’re brothers in blood, after all.’ Iben, as if 
feadng the Don would be offended, he clutched at his hand. 
*Stay with me, let me hold your hand. We’ll outwit that 
bastard as we’ve outwitted others. Godfether, don’t betray me.* 

The Don motioned the other people out of the room. They 
left. He took the withered claw of Genco Abbandando in his 
own two broad hands. Softly, reassuringly, he comforted his 
friend, as they waited for deadi together. As if the Don could 
truly snatch the life, of Genco Abbandando back from that 
most foul and criminal traitor to man. 

The wedding day of Connie Corleone ended well for her. 
Carlo Bjzsd performed his duties as a bridegroom with skill 
and vigour, spurred on by the contents of the bride’s gift purse 
which totall^ up to over twenty thousand dolbrs. The 
bride, however, gave up her virginity^ with a great deal more 
willingness than she gave up her purse. For the latter, he had 
to blacken one of her eyes. 

Lucy Mancini waited in her house for a call from Sonny 
Corleone, sure that he would ask her for a date. Finally she 
called his house and whenshe heard a woman’s voice answer the 
phoneshehungup. Shehadno way ofknowing that nearly every- 
one at the wedding had remarked the absence of her and Sonny 
for that fatal half hour and the gossip was already spreading 
that Santino Corleone had found another victim. That he 
had Mone the job’ on his own sister’s maid of honour. 

Amerigo Donasera had a terrible nightmare. In his dreams 
he saw Don Corleone, in peaked cap, overalls,’and heavy 
gloves, unloading bullet-riddled corpses in front of his funeral 
parlour and shouting, * Remember, Amerigo, not a word to 
anyone, and bury them quickly.’ He groaned so loudandlong in 
his sleep that his wife shook him awake. *Eh, what a man you 
are,’ she grumbled. * To have a nightmare only after a wedding. ’ 

Kay Adams was escorted to her New York City hotel by 
PauUe Gatto and Qdnenaa. The car was large, luxurious, and 
driven by Gatto. Qemenza sat in the back seat and Kay was 


47 



gived the front seat next to the ddver. She found both men 
wildly exotic. Their speech ^was movie Brooklynese and they 
treated her with exaggerated courtliness. Duri^ the ride she 
chatted casually with both men and was surprised when they 
spoke of Michael with unmistakable a£Fection and tespect. He 
had led het to believe* that he was an alien in his fafoer*s 
world. Now Clemenxa was assuring her in his wheeaing 
guttural voice that the ‘old man* thought Mike was the best of 
his sons, the one who would surely inherit the fiimily business. 

‘ What business is that ? ’ Kay asked in the most natural way. 

Paulie Gatto gave hei* a quick glance as he turned the 
wheel. Behind her Qemenza said in a surprised voice. ‘Dida*t 
Mike tell you? Mr Q>rleone is the biggest importer of Italian 
olive oil in the States. Now that the war is over the business 
could get real rich. He*ll need a smart boy like Mike.’ 

At the hotel Clemenxa insisted on coming to the desk with 
het. When she protested, he said simply, ‘The boss said to 
make sure you got home OK. I gotta do it.* 

After she received her room key he walked her to the 
elevator and waited until she got in. She waved to him, 
smiling, and was surprised at his genuine smile of pleasure in 
return. It was just as well she did not see him go iMck to the 
hotel clerk and ask, ‘ What name she registered under?* 

Tlic hotel clerk looked at Qemenza coldly. Qemenza rolled 
the little green spitball he was holding in his hand across to the 
clerk, who picked it up and immediately said, ‘Mr and Mrs 
Michael Corleone.* 

Back in the car, Paulie Gatto said, ‘Nice dame.* 

Qemenza grunted. ‘ Mike is doing the job on her.’ Unless, 
he thought, they were really married. ‘Pick me up early in the 
morning,* he told Paulie. G^tto. ‘Hagen got some deal for us 
that gotta be done tight away.’ 

It was late Sunday night before Tom Hagen could kiss his 
wife goodbye and drive out to the airport. With his special 
number one priority (a grateful gift ftom a Pentagon staff 
general ofHcer) he no trouble getting on a plane to Los 
Angeles. 

It had been a busy but satisfying day for Tom Hagen. Genco 

48 



AbbaddAndo had died at three in the morning and when Don 
Corleonc returned from the hospital, he had informed Hagen 
that he wsa now officially the new ConsigHm to the fitmily. 
This meant that Hagen was sure to become a very xidi man, to 
say nothing of power* 

The Don had broken a long-standing ttadition. The 
Consiglim was always a full-blooded Sicilian, and the fact that 
Hagen had been brought up as a member of the Don’s family 
made no difierence to that tradition. It was a question of blood- 
Only a Sicilian bom to the ways of omerta^ the law of silence, 
could be trusted in the key post of Consigliori. 

Between the head of the fiunily, Don G>rleone, who dic- 
tated policy, and the operating krel of men who actually 
carried out ^e orders of the Don, there were three layers, or 
bufiers. In that way nothing could be traced to the top. Unless 
the Consigli&ri turned traitor. That Sunday morning Don 
Corleone gave explicit instructions on what should be done to 
the two young men who hsul beaten the daughter of Amerigo 
Bonasera. But he had given those orders in private to Tom 
Hagen. Later in the day Hagen had, also in private without 
witnesses, instructed Oemenaa. In turn Oememai had told 
Paulie Gatto to execute the commission. Paulie Gatto would 
now muster the necessary manpower and execute the orders. 
Paulie Gatto and his men would not know why this particular 
task was being carried out or who had ordered it originally. 
Each link of the chain would have to turn traitor for the Don 
to be involved and though it had never yet happened, there 
was always the possibility. The cure for that possibility also 
was known. Only one link in the chain had to ^sappear. 

The Cmmgiiori was also what his name implied. JFie was the 
counsellor to the Don, his right-hand man, his aui^iary brain. 
He was also hiS closest companion and his closest friend. On 
important trips he would drive the Don’s car, at conferences 
he would go out and get the Don refreshments, codec and 
sandwiches, fresh cigars. He would know everything the Don 
knew or nearly everything, all the cells of power. He was the 
one man in the world who could bring the Don crashing down 
to destruction. But no CMsigfim had ever betrayed a Don, not 
in the memory of any of the powerful Sicilian fisimilies who had 


49 



estibliilied tfaemtelyes in Afnedcm. Tl^ 

And every CmuigUm knew that if he kept the 6ddi, be would 
become licfa, wkdd power, and win reipect. If miifortune 
came, his wife and children would be sheltered and cared £6t 
as if ^ were alhre or free. I/Jk kgpt /fe ftM. 

In some matters die Cmsigfhri had to act for his Don in a 
more open way and yet not involve his principal. Hagen was 
flying to Qdifotnia on just such a matter. He realhsed that his 
career as Cmmglkri woidd be seriously affxted by the success 
or feihire of this mission. By femily business standards whether 
Johnny Fontane got his coveted part in the war movie^ or did 
no^ was a minor matter. Far more important was the meeting 
Hagen had set- up with Virgil SoUosbeo the following Friday. 
But Hagen knew that to the Don, both were of equal impor- 
tance, which setded the matter for any good Consig^ori. 

The piston plane shook Tom Hagen’s already nervous in- 
sides and he ordered a martini from the hostess to quiet them. 
Both the Don and Johnny had briefed him on die character of 
the movie producer. Jack Wdka. From everything that Johnny 
said, Hagen knew he would never be able to persuade Wolta. 
But he also had no doubt whatsoever that the Don would keep 
his promise to Johnny; His own role was that of negotiator 
and contact. 

Lying back in his seat, Hagen went over all the information 
given to him that day. Jack Woita was one of the three most 
important movie producecs in Hollywood, owner of his own 
studio with doaens of stars under conttact. He wis on the 
President of the United States* Advisory Council for War 
Information, Cinematic Division, which meant simply that he 
helped make propaganda movie^ He had had dinner at the 
White flouse. He had entertained J. Edgar Hoover in his 
Hollywood home. But none of this was as impressive as it 
sounded. They were all oflSdal relationships. Woltz didn’thave 
any personal political power, mainly because he was an 
extreme reactionary, pa^y because he was a m^alomaniac 
who loved to wield power wildly without regard to the feet 
that by so doing legions of enmics sprang up out of the 
ground. 

Hagen sighed. There would be no way to * handle’ Jadt 

JO 



Wolt2. He opened his briefcase and tried to get some paper 
work done, but he was too tired. He ordered another martini 
and reflected on his life. He had no regrets, indeed he felt that 
he had been extremely lucky. Whatever the reason, the course 
he had chosen ten years ago had proved to be right for him. 
He was successful, he was as happy as any grown man could 
reasonably expect, and he found life interesting. 

Tom Hagen was thirty-five years old, a tall crew-cut man, 
very slender, very ordinary-looking. He was a lawyer but did 
not do the actual detailed legal work for the Corleone family 
business though he had practised law for three years after 
passing the bar exsm. 

At the age of eleven he had been a playmate of eleven-year 
old Sonny Corleone. Hagen’s mother had gone blind and then 
died during his eleventh year. Hagen’s father, a heavy drinker, 
had become a hopeless drunkard. A hard-working carpenter, 
he had never done a dishonest thing in his life. But his drinking 
destroyed his family and finally killed him. Tom Hagen was 
left an orphan who wandered the streets and slept in hallways. 
His younger sister had been put in a foster home, but in the 
1 920s the social agencies did not follow up cases of twelve- 
year-old boys who were so ungrateful as to run from their 
charity. Hagen, too, had an eye infection. Neighbours whis- 
pered that he had caught or inherited it from his mother and so 
therefore it could be caught from him. He was shunned. Sonny 
Corleone, a warmhearted and imperious eleven-year-old, had 
brought his friend home and demanded that he be taken in. 
Tom Hagen was given a hot dish of spaghetti with oily rich 
tomato sauce, the taste of which he had never forgotten, and 
then given a metal folding bed to sleep on. « 

In the most natural way, without a word being spoken or 
the matter discussed in any feshion, Don Corleone had per- 
mitted the boy to stay in his household. Don Corleone himself 
took the boy to a special doctor and had his eye infection 
cured. He sent him to college and law school. In all this the 
Don acted not as a father but rather as a guardian. There was 
no show of afiection but oddly enough the Don treated Hagen 
more courteously than his own sons, did not impose a parental 
will upon him. It was the boy’s decision to go tp law school 





after college. He bad heard Don G>rleoiie say once, lawyer 
with his briefcase can steal more than a hundred men with 
guns.’ Meanwhile, much to the annoyance of their father. 
Sonny and Freddie insisted on going into the family business 
after graduation from high school. Only Michael had gone on 
to college, and he had enlisted in the Marines the day after 
Pearl Harbor. 

After he passed the bar eaatn, Hagen married to start his 
own family. The bride was a young Italian girl from New 
Jersey, rare at that time for being a college graduate. After the 
wedding, which was of course held in the home of Don 
Corlcone, the Don offered to support Hagen in any under- 
taking he desired, to send him law clients, furnish his oftice, 
start him in real estate. 

Tom Hagen had bowed his head and said to the Don, ’I 
would like to work for you.’ 

The Don was surprised, yet pleased. ‘You know who I am? ’ 
he asked. 

Hagen nodded. He hadn’t really known the extent of the 
Don’s power, not then. He did not really know m the ten 
years that followed until he was made the acting Consiguori 
after Genco Abbandando became ill. But he nodded and met 
the Don’s eyes with his own. ‘I would work for you like your 
sons,’ Hagen said, meaning with complete loyalty, with com- 
plete acceptance of the Don’s parental divinity. The Don, with 
that understanding which was even then building the legend 
of his greatness, showed the young man the first mark ofr 
fstherly affection since he had come into his household. He 
took Hagen into his arms for a quick embrace and afterwards 
treated him more like a true son, though he would sometimes 
say, ‘Tbm, never forget your parents,’ as if he were reminding 
himself as well as Hagen. 

There was no chance that Hagen would forget. His mother 
had been near moronic and slovenly, so ridden by anaemia she 
could not feel affection for her children or make a pretence of 
it. His father Hagen had hated. His mother’s blindness before 
she died had terriff ed him and his own eye infection had been a 
stroke of doom. He had been sure he would go blind. When 
his father died, Tom Hagen’s eleven-year-old mind had 


54 



snapped in a curious way. He had roamed the streets like an 
animal waiting for death until the fateful day Sonny found him 
sleeping in the back of a hallway and brought him to his home. 
What had happened afterwards was a miracle. But for years 
Hagen had had nightmares, dreaming he had grown to man- 
hood blind, tapping a white cane, his blind children behind 
him tap-tapping with their little white canes as they begged in 
the streets. Some mornings when he woke the face of Don 
Q>rlcone was imprinted on his brain in that first conscious 
moment and he would feel safe. 

But the Don had insisted that he put in three years of general 
law practice in addition to his duties for the family business. 
This experience had proved invaluable later on, and also re- 
moved any doubts in Hagen’s mind about working for Don 
Corleone. He had then spent two years of training in the offices 
of a top firm of criminal law'yers in which the Don had some 
influence. It was apparent to everyone that he had a flair for 
this branch of the law. He did well and when be went into the 
full-time service of the family business, Don Corleone had not 
been able to reproach him once in the six years that followed. 

When he had been made the acting Consigliori, the other 
powerful Sicilian families referred contemptuously to the Cor- 
leone family as the * Irish gang’. This had amused Hagen. It 
had also taught him that he could never hope to succeed the 
Don as the head of the fiunily business. But he was content. 
That had never been his goal, such an ambition would have 
been a 'disrespect’ to his benefiictor and his benefactor’s 
blood family. 

It was still dark when the plane landed in Loa Angeles. 
Hagen checked into his hotel, showered and shaved, and 
watclied dawn come over the dty. He ordered breakfast and 
newspapers to be sent up to his room and relaxed undl it was 
time for his ten am appointment with Jack Woltz. The ap- 
pointment had been surprisingly easy to make. 

The day before, Hagen had c^ed the most powerful man in 
the movie labour unions, a man named Billy Gofl. Acting on 
instructions from Don Corleone, Hagen had told Go£F to 
arrange an appointment on the next day for Hagen to call on 


55 



Jack Woltz, that he should hint to Woltz diat if Hagen was not 
made happy by the results of the interview, there could be a 
labour strike at the movie studio. An hour later Hagen re- 
ceived a call from Goff. The appointment would be at ten 
AM. Woltz had got the message about the possible labour 
strike but hadn’t seemed too impressed, GofiF said. He added, 
‘If it really comes down to tl:^t, 1 gotta talk to the Don 
myself.’ 

‘If it comes to that he’ll talk to you,’ Hagen said. By saying 
this he avoided making any promises. He was not surprised 
that GoflF was so agreeable to the Don’s wishes. The family 
empire, technically, did not extend beyond the New York area 
but Don CorleoiiC had first become strong by helping labour 
leaders. Many of them still owed him debts of friendship. 

But the ten am appointment was a bad sign. It meant that he 
would be first on the appointment list, that he would not be 
invited to lunch. It meant that Woltz held him in small worth. 
Goff had not been threatening enough, probably because 
Woltz had him on his graft payroll. And sometimes the Don’s 
success in keeping himself out of the limelight worked to the 
disadvantage of the family business, in that his name did not 
mean anything to outside circles. 

His analysis proved correct. Woltz kept him waiting for a 
half liour past the appointed time. Hagen didn’t mind. The 
reception room was very plush, very comfortable, and on a 
plum-coloured couch opposite him sat the most beautiful child 
Hagen had ever seen. She was no more than eleven or twelve, 
dressed in a very expensive but simple way as a grown woman. 
She had incredibly golden hair, huge deep sea-blue eyes and a 
fresh raspberry-red mouth. She was guarded by a woman 
obviously her mother, who tried to stare Hagen down with a 
cold arrogance that made him want to punch her in the face. 
The angel child and the dragon mother, Hagen thought, 
returning the mother’s cold stare. 

Finally an exquisitely dressed but stout middle-aged woman 
came to lead him through a string of offices to the office-apart- 
ment of the movie producer. Hagen was impressed by the 
beauty of the offices and the people working in them. He 
smiled. They were all shrewdies, trying to get their foot in the 


54 



movie door by taking office jobs, and most of them would 
work in these offices for the rest of their lives or until they 
accepted defeat and returned to their home towns. 

Jack Woltz was a tall, powerfully built man with a heavy 
paunch almost concealed by his perfectly tailored suit. Hagen 
knew his history. At ten years of age Woltz had hustled empty 
beer kegs and pushcarts on the East Side. At twenty he helped 
his father sweat garment workers. At thirty he had left New 
York and moved West, invested in the nickelodeon, and 
pioneered motion pictures. At forty-eight he had been the 
most powerful movie magnate in Hollywood, still rough- 
spoken, rapaciously amorous, a raging wolf ravaging helpless 
flocks of young starlets. At fifty he transformed himself. He 
took speech lessons, learned how to dress from an English 
valet, and how to behave socially from an English buder. 
When his first wife died he married a world-famous and beaud- 
ful actress who didn’t like acting. Now at the age of sixty he 
collected old master paintings, was a member of the President’s 
Advisory Committee, and had set up a multimillion-doUar 
foimdadon in his name to promote art in modon pictures. His 
daughter had married an English lord, his son an Italian 
princess. 

His latest passion, as reported dutifully by every movie 
columnist in America, was his own racing stables on which he 
had spent ten million dollars in the past year. He had made 
headlines by purchasing the funed English racing horse 
Khartoum for the incredible price of six hundred thousand 
dollars and then announcing that the undefeated racer would 
be retired and put to stud exclusively for the Woltz stables. 

He received Hagen courteously, his beautifi^y, evenly 
tanned, meticulously barbered flsce contorted with a grimace 
meant to be a smile. Despite all the money spent, despite die 
ministradons of the most knowledgeable technicians, his age 
showed; the flesh of his face looked as if it had been seamed 
together. But there was an enormous vitality in his movements 
and he had what Don Corleone had, the air of a man who 
commanded absolutely the world in which he lived. 

Hagen came direedy to the point. That he was an emissary 
ftx>m a fnend of Johnny Fontane. That this friend was a very 


55 



powerful man who would pledge his gratitude and undying 
friendship to Mr Woitz if Mr Woltz would grant a small 
favour. The small favour would be the casting of Johnny 
Fontane in the new war movie the studio planned to start next 
week. 

The seamed face was impassive^ polite. ‘What favours can 
your friend do me?’ Woltz asked. There was just a trace of 
condescension in his voice. 

Hagen ignored the condescension. He explained. ‘You’ve 
got some labour trouble coming up. My friend can absolutely 
guarantee to make that trouble disappear. You have a top 
malc'star who makes a lot of money for your studio but he just 
graduated from marijuana to heroin. My friend wili guarantee 
that your male star won’t be able to get any more heroin. And 
if some other little thmgs come up over the years a phone call 
to me can solve your problems.’ 

Jack Woltz listened to this as if he were hearmg the boasting 
of a child. Then he said harshly, his voice deliberately ail Bast 
Side, ‘You trying to put muscle on me?’ 

Hagen said coolly, ‘Absolutely not. I’ve come to ask a 
service for a friend. I’ve tried to explain that you won’t lose 
an 3 rthing by it.* 

Almost as if he willed it, Woltz made his face a mask of 
anger. The mouth curled, his heavy brows, dyed black, con- 
tracted to form a thick line over his glinting eyes. He leaned 
over the desk towards Hagen. ‘All right, you smooth son of a 
bitch, let me lay it on the line for you and your boss, whoever 
he is. Johnny Fontane never gets that movie. I don’t care how 
many guinea Mafia goombahs come out of the woodwork.' 
He leaned back. ‘A word of advice to you, my friend. J. Edgar 
Hoovcf, 1 assume you’ve heard of him ’ - Woltz smiled sar- 
donically - ' IS a personal friend of mine. If I let him know I’m 
being pressured, you guys will never know what hit you.’ 

Hagen listened patiently. He had expected better from a man 
of Woltz’s stature. Was it possible that a man who acted this 
stupidly could rise to the head of a company worth hundreds 
of millions ? That was something to think about since the Don 
was looking for new things to put money into, and if the top 
brains of this industry were so dumb, movies might be the 

56 



thing. The abuse itself bothered him not at all. Hagen had 
learned the art of negotiation from the Don himself. ‘ Nevet 
get angry,’ the Don had instructed. ‘Never make a threat. 
Reason with people.’ The word ‘reason’ sounded so much 
bettei in Italian, rajmahy to rejom. The art of dus was to ignore 
all insults, all threats; to turn the othet cheek. Hagen had seeii 
the Don sii at a negotiating table for eight hours, swallowing 
insults, trying to persuade a notorious and megalomaniac 
strong-arm man to mend his ways. At the end of the eight 
hours Don Corleone had thrown up his hands in a helpless 
gesture and said to the other men at the table, ‘ But no one can 
reason with this fellow,’ and had stalked out of the meeting 
room. The strong-arm man had turned white with fear, 
tsmis&aries were sent to bring the I^ori back into the room. An 
agreement was reached but two months later the strong-arm 
man was shot to death in his favourite barbershop. 

So Plagen started again, speaking in the most ordinary voice. 
‘Look at my card,’ he said. ‘I’m a lawyer. Would I stick my 
neck out? Have I uttered one threatening word? Let me just 
say that I am prepared to meet any condition you name to get 
Johnny Fontane that movie. 1 think I’ve already offered a great 
deal for such a small favour. A favour that I understand it 
would be in your interest to grant. Johnny tells me that you 
admit he would be perfect for that part. And let me say that 
this favour would never be asked if that were not so. In fact, if 
you're worried about your investment, my client would 
finance the picture. But please let me make myself absolutely 
clear. Wc understand your no is no. Nobody can force you or 
is trying to. Wc know about your friendship with Mr Hoover, 
I may add, and my boss respects you for it. He respects that 
relationship very much.’ 

Woltz had been doodling with a huge, red-feathered pen. At 
the mention of money his interest was aroused and he stopped 
doodling. He said patronizingly, ‘This picture is budgeted at 
five million.’ 

Hagen whistled softly to show that he was impressed. Then 
he said very casually, ‘My boss has a lot of friends who back 
his judgement.’ 

For the first time Woltz seemed to take the whole thing 

57 



seriously. He studied Hagen’s card. ‘I never heard of you/ he 
said. ‘I know most of the big lawyers in New York, but just 
who the hell are you?’ 

‘I have one of those dignified corporate practices,’ Hagen 
said dryly. ‘I just handle this one account.’ He rose, ‘I won’t 
take up any more of your time.’ He held out his hand, Woltz 
shook it. Hagen took a few steps towards the door and turned 
to face Woltz again. ‘ I understand you have to deal with a lot 
of people who try to seem more important than they are. In 
my case the reverse is true. Why don’t you check me out with 
our mutual friend? If you reconsider, call me at my hotel.* He 
paused. ‘This may be sacrilege to you, but my client can do 
things for you that even Mr Hoover might find out of his 
range.* He saw the movie producer’s eyes narrowing. Woltz 
was finally getting the message. ‘By the way, 1 admire your 
pictures very much,’ Hagen said in the most fawning voice he 
could manage. ‘I hope you can keep up the good work. Our 
country needs it.* 

Late that afternoon Hagen received a call from the pro- 
ducer’s secretary that a car would pick him up within the hour 
to take him out to Mr Woltz’s country home for dinner. She 
told him it would be about a three-hour drive but that the car 
was equipped with a bar and some hors d’oeuvres. Hagen 
knew that Woltz made the trip in his private plane and 
wondered why he hadn’t been invited to make the trip by air. 
The secretary’s voice was adding politely, ‘ Mr Woltz suggested 
you bring an overnight bag and he’ll get you to the airport in 
the morning.’ 

‘I’ll do that,’ Hagen said. That was another thing to wonder 
about. How did Woltz know he was taking the morning plane 
back tb New York? He thought about it for a moment. The 
most likely explanation was that Woltz had set private de- 
tectives on his trail to get all possible information. Then Woltz 
certainly knew he represent^ the Don, which meant that he 
knew something about the Don, which in turn meant that he 
was now ready to take the whole matter seriously. Something 
might be done after all, Hagen thought. And maybe Woltz 
was smarter than he had appoired this morning. 



The home of Jack Wolt 2 looked likc^ an implausible movie 
set. There was a plantation-type mansion, huge grounds 
girdled by a rich black dirt bridle path, stables and pasture for 
a herd of horses. The hedges, flower beds, and grasses were as 
carefully manicured as a movie star’s nails. 

Wolta greeted Hagen on a glass-panel air-conditioned porch. 
The producer was informally dressed in blue silk shirt open at 
the neck, mustard-coloured slacks, soft leather sandals. 
Framed in all this colour and rich flibric his seamed, tough face 
Was startling. He handed Hagen an outsked martini glass and 
took one for himself from the prepared tray. He seemed more 
friendly than he had been earlier in the day. He put his arm 
over Hagen’s shoulder and said, * We have a little time before 
dinner, let’s go look at my horses.’ As they walked towards the 
stables he said, "1 checked you out, Tom; you should have 
told me your boss is Corleone. 1 thought you were just some 
third-rate hustler Johnny was running in to bluff me. And I 
don’t blufl. Not that I want to make enemies, 1 never believed 
in that. But let’s just enjoy ourselves now. We can talk 
business after dinner.’ 

Surprisingly Woitz proved to be a truly considerate host. 
He explained his new methods, innovations that he hoped 
would make his stable the most successful in America. The 
stables were all fire-proofed, sanitked to the highest degree, 
and guarded by a special security detail of private detectives. 
FinaUy Woitz led him to a stall which had a huge bronze 
plaque attached to its outside wall. On the plaque was the 
name ^Khartoum’. 

The horse inside the stall was, even to Hagen’s inex- 
perienced eyes, a beautiful animal. Khartoum’s skin was jet 
black except for a diamond-shaped white patch on his huge 
forehead. The great brown eyes glinted like golden apples, the 
black skin over the taut body was silk. Woitz said with childish 
pride, ‘The greatest racehorse in the world. I bought him in 
England last year for six hundred grand. I bet even the 
Russian Czars never paid that much for a single horse. But I’m 
not going to race hixn, I’m going to put him to stud. Fm going 
to build the greatest racing stable this country has ever 
known.’ He stroked die horse^s mane and called out sofdy, 


59 



'Khartoum, Khartoum.* There was real love in his voice and 
the animal responded. Woltz said to Hagen, 'Tm a good 
horseman, you know, and the first time 1 ever rode I was fifty 
years old.* He laughed. 'Maybe one of my grandmothers in 
Russia got raped by a G)ssack and I got his blood.* He tickled 
Khartoum’s belly and said with sincere admiration, ‘ Look at 
that cock on him. 1 should have such a cock.* 

They went back to the mansion to have dinner. It was served 
by three waiters under the command of a butler, the table 
linen and ware were all gold thread and silver, but Hagen 
found the food mediocre. Woltz obviously lived alone, and 
just as obviously was not a man who cared about food. Hagen 
waited until they had both lit up huge Havana cigars before he 
asked Woltz, ‘Does Johnny get it or not?’ 

‘I can’t,* Woltz said. ‘I can’t put Johnny into that picture 
even if I wanted to. The contracts arc all signed for all the 
performers and the cameras roll next week. There’s no way I 
can swing it.’ 

Hagen said impatiently, ‘Mr Woltz, the big advantage of 
dealing with a man at the top is that such an excuse is not valid. 
You can do anything you want to do.* He puffed on his cigar. 
‘ Don’t you believe my client * 2 ah keep his promises ? ’ 

Woltz said dryly, ‘I believe that I’m going to have labour 
trouble. Goff called me up on that, the son of a bitch, and the 
way he talked to me you’d never guess I pay him a hundred 
grand a year under the table. And I believe you can get that 
fag he-man star of mine off heroin. But I don’t care about that 
and 1 can finance my own pictures. Because 1 hate that bastard 
Fontane. Tell your boss tliis is one favour 1 can’t give but that 
he should try me again on anything else. Anything at all.’ 

Hagdn tliought, you sneaky bastard, then why the hell did 
you bring me all the way out here? The producer had some- 
thing on his mind. Hagen said coldly, ‘I don’t think you 
understand the situation. Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontanc’s 
godfather. That is a very close, a very sacred religious relation- 
ship.* Woltz bowed his head in respect at this reference to re- 
ligion. Hagen went on. ‘Italians have a little joke, that the 
world is so hard a man must have two fathers to look after 
him, and that’s why they have godfathers. Since Johnny’s 

6o 



father died, Mr Corleone feels his responsibility even more 
deeply. As for trying you again, Mr Corleone is much too 
sensitive. He never asks a second favour where he has been 
refused the first/ 

Woltz shrugged. ‘Tm sorry. The answer is still no. But since 
you'^rc here, what will it cost me to have that labour trouble 
cleared up? In czsh. Right now.' 

That solved one puzzle for Hagen. Why Woltz was putting 
in so much time on him when he had already decided not to 
give Johnny the part. And that could not be changed at this 
mteeting. Woltz felt secure; he was not afraid of the power of 
Don Corleone. And certainly Woltz with his national political 
connexions, his acquaintanceship with the FBI chief, his 
huge personal fortune, and his absolute power in the film 
industry, could not feel threatened by Don Corleone. To any 
intelligent man, even to Hagen, it seemed that Woltz had 
correctly assessed his position. He was impregnable to the Don 
if he was willing to take the losses the labour struggle would 
cost. There was only one thing wrong with the whole equa- 
tion. Don Corleone liad promised his godson he would get the 
part and Don Corleone had never, to Hagen's knowledge, 
broken his word in such matters. 

Hagen said quietly, * You arc deliberately misimdcrstanding 
me. You are trying to make me an accomplice to extortion. Mr 
Corleone promises only to .speak in your favour on this labour 
trouble as a Oiatter of friendsnip in return for your speaking in 
behalf of liis client. A friendly exchange of influence, nothing 
more. But 1 can see you don't take me seriously. Personally, 1 
think that is a mistake.' 

Woltz. as if he had been waiting for such a moment, let him- 
self get angry. ‘I understood perfectly,' he said, ‘that's the 
Mafia style, isn't it? All oiivc oil and sweet talk when what 
you're really doing is making threats. So let me lay it on the 
line. Johnny Fontana will never get that part and he’s perfect 
for it. It would make him a great star. But he never will be 
because I hate that pinko punk and I’m going to run him out of 
the movies. And I'll tell you why. He ruined one of my most 
valuable profegdes. For five years 1 had this girl under train- 
ing, singing, dancing, acting lessons, I spent hundreds of 

6i 



thousands of dollars. I was going to make her a star. I’ll be even 
more frank, just to show you that I’m not a hard-hearted man, 
that it wasn’t all dollars and cents. That girl was beautiful and 
she was the greatest piece of ass I’ve ever had and I’ve had them 
all over the world. She could suck you out like a water pump. 
Then Johnny comes along with that olive-oil voice and guinea 
charm and she runs off. She threw it all away just to make me 
ridiculous. A man in my position, Mr Hagen, can’t afford to 
look ridiculous. I have to pay Johnny off.’ 

For the first time, Woltz succeeded in astounding Hagen. 
He found it inconceivable that a grown man of substance 
would let such trivialities affect his judgement in an affair of 
business, and one of such importance. In Hagen’s world, the 
Corlcones’ world, the physical beauty, the sexual power of 
women, carried not the slightest weight in worldly matters. It 
was a private affair, except, of course, in matters of marriage 
and family disgrace. Hagen decided to make one last try. 

‘You are absolutely right, Mr Woltz,’ Hagen said. ‘But are 
your grievances that major? I don’t think you’ve understood 
how important this very small favour is to my client. Mr 
Corleone held the infant Johnny in his arms when he was 
baptized. When Johnny’s father died, Mr Q>rleone assumed 
the duties of parenthood, indeed he is called “Godfather” by 
many people who wish to show their respect and gratitude for 
the help he has given them, Mr Corleone never lets his friends 
down.’ 

Woltz stood ^p abruptly. ‘I’ve listened to about enough. 
Thugs don’t give me orders, I give them orders. If I pick up 
this phone, you’ll spend the night in jail. And if that Mafia 
goombah tries any rough stuff, he’ll find out I’m not a band 
leader. Yeah, I heard that story too. Listen, your Mr Corleone 
will never know what hit him. Even if I have to use my 
influence at the White House.’ 

The stupid, stupid son of a bitch. How the hell did he get to 
be a pev^nwantty Hagen wondered. Advisor to the President, 
head of the biggest movie studio in the world. Definitely the 
Don should get into the movie business. And the guy was 
taking his words at their sentimental face value. He was not 
getting the message. 


6i 



*Thank yoa for the dimier and a pleasant evening,’ Hagen 
said. 'Could you give me transportation to the airport? 1 don’t 
think I’ll spend the night.’ He smiled coldly at Wolt 2 . 'Mr 
Corleone is a man who insists on hearing bad news at once/ 

While waiting in the floodlit colonnade of the mansion for 
his car, Hagen saw two women about to enter a long limousine 
already parked in the driveway. They were the beautiful 
twelve-year-old blonde girl and her mother ^e had seen in 
Woltz’s oflice that morning. But now the girl’s exquisitely cut 
mouth seemed to have smeared into a thick, pink mass. Her 
sea-blue eyes were Aimed over and when she walked down the 
steps towards the open car her long legs tottered like a crippled 
foal’s. Her mother supported the child, helping her into the 
car, hissing commands into her ear. The mother’s head turned 
for a quick furtive look at Hagen and he saw in her eyes a 
burning, hawklike triumph. Then she too disappeared into the 
limousine. 

So that was why he hadn’t got the plane ride from Los 
Angeles, Hagen thought. The girl and her mother had made 
the trip with the movie producer. That had given Woltz 
enough time to relax before dinner and do the job on the little 
kid. And Johnny wanted to live in this world? Good luck to 
him, and good luck to Woltz. 

Paulie Gatto hated quickie jobs, especially when they in- 
volved violence. He liked to plan things ahead. And some- 
thing like tonight, even though it was punk stuff, could turn 
into serious business if somebody made a mistake. Now, 
sipping his beer, he glanced around, checking how the two 
young punks were making out with the two little tramps at the 
bar. 

Paulie Gatto knew everything there was to know about 
those two punks. Their names were Jerry Wagner and Kevin 
Moonan. They were both about twenty years old, good-look- 
ing, brown-haired, tall, well-built. Both were due to go back 
to college out of town in two weeks, both had fathers with 
political influence and this, with their college student classifi- 
cation, had so far kept them out of the draft. Hiey were both 
also under suspended sentences for assaulting the daughter of 

65 



Amerigo Bonasera. The lou87 bastards, Paulic Gatto thought. 
Draft dodging, violating their probation by drinking in a 
bar after midnight, chasing floozies. Young punks. Paulie 
Gatto had been deferred from the draft himself because 
his doctor had furnished the draft board with documents 
showing that this patient, male, white, aged twenty-six, un- 
married, had received electrical shock treatments for a mental 
condition. All false of course, but Paulie Gatto felt that he 
bad earned his draft exemption. It had been arranged by 
Ciemenza after Gatto had ‘made his bones’ in the family 
business. 

It was Ciemenza who had told him that this job must be. 
rashed through, before the boys went to college. Why the hell 
did it have to be done in New York, Gatto wondered. Clc- 
menza was always giving extra orders instead of just giving 
out the job. Now if those two little tramps walked out with 
the punks it would be another night wasted. 

He could hear one of the girls laughing and saying, ‘Are you 
crazy, Jerry? Tm not going in any car with you. i don't want 
to wind up in the hospital like that other poor girl.’ Her voice 
was spitefully rich with satisfaction. That was enough for 
Gatto, He finished up his beer and walked out into the dark 
street. Perfect. It was after midnight. There was only one other 
bar that showed light. The rest of the stores were closed. The 
precinct patrol car had been taken care of by Ciemenza. They 
wouldn’t be aiound that way until they got a radio call and 
then they’d come slow. 

He leaned against the four-door Chevy sedan. In the back 
scat two men were sitting, almost invisible, although they 
were very big men. Paulie said, ‘Take them when they come 
out.’ 

He still thought it had all been set up too fast. Ciemenza had 
given him copies ot the police mug shots of the two punks, the 
dope on where the punks went drinking every ni ght to pick up 
bar girls. Paulie had recruited two of the strong-arms in the 
family and fingered the punks for them. He had also given 
them their instructions. No blows on the top or the back of the 
head, there was to be no accidental fetality. Other «-han that 
they could go as far as they liked. He bad given them only one 

64 



warning; *If those punks get out of the hospital in less than a 
month, you guys go back to driving trucks/ 

The two big men were getting out of the car. They were 
both ex-boxers who Had never made it past the small clubs and 
had been fixed up by Sonny Corleone with a little loan-shark 
action so that they could make a decent living. They were, 
naturally, anxious to show their gratitude. 

When Jerry Wagner and Kevin Moonan came out of the bar 
they were perfect setups. The bar girl’s taunts had left their 
adolescent vanity prickly. Paulie Gatto, leaning against the 
fender of his car, called out to them with a teasing laugh, 
‘Hey, Casanova, those broads really brushed you off.’ 

The two young men turned on him with delight. Paulie 
Gatto looked like a perfect outlet for their humiliation. Ferret- 
faced, short, slightly built, and a wise guy in the bargain. They 
pounced on him eagerly and immediately found their arms 
pinned by two men grabbing them from behind. At the same 
moment Paulie Gatto had slipped onto his right hand, a 
specially made set of brass knuckles studded with one- 
sixteenth-inch iron spikes. His timing was good, he worked 
out in the gym three times a week. He smashed the punk 
named Wagner right on the nose. The man holding Wagner 
lifted him up off the ground and Paulie swung his arm, 
uppercutting ii^to the perfectly positioned groin. Wagner 
went Ump and the big man dropped him« This had taken no 
more than six seconds. 

Now both of them turned their attention to Kevin Moonan, 
who was trying to shout. The man holding him from behind 
did so easily with one huge muscled arm. The other hand he 
put around Moonan ’s throat to cut off any sound. , 

Paulie Gatto jumped into the car and started the motor. The 
two big men were beating Moonan to jelly. They did so with 
(ngbtening deliberation, as if they bad all the time in the 
world. They did not throw punches in flurries but in timed, 
slow-motion sequences that carried the full weight of their 
massive bodies. Each blow landed with a jp/a/ of flesh 
splitting open. Gatto got a glimpse of Moonan^s face. It was 
The two mea ieft Mooaaa lying on the a'dc- 

»n tufned tbeir atteatim to Wagaer. Wagaer waa tryiag 



to get to his feet and he started to scream for help. Someone 
came out of the bar and the two men had to work faster now. 
They clubbed Wagner to his knees. One of the men took his 
arm and twisted it, then kicked him in the spine. There was a 
cracking sound and Wagner’s scream of agony brought 
windows open all along the street. The two men worked very 
quickly. One of them held Wagner up by using his two hands 
around Wagner’s head like a vice. The other man smashed his 
huge fist into the fixed target. There were more people coming 
out of the bar but none tried to interfere. Paulie Gatto yelled, 
‘ Come on, enough.* 'Hie two big men jumped into the car and 
Paulie gunned it away. Somebody would describe the car and 
read the licence plates but it didn’t matter. It was a stolen 
California plate and there were one hundred thousand black 
Chevy sedans in New York City. 


CHAPTER^TWO 


Tom Hagen went to his law office in the city on Thursday 
morning. He planned to catch up on his paper work so as to 
have ever3rthing cleared away for the meeting with Virgd 
Sollozao on Friday. A meeting of such importance that he had 
asked the Don for a full evening of talk to prepare for the 
proposition they knew SoUozzo would offer the family 
business. Hagen wanted to have all little details cleared away 
so that he could go to that preparatory meeting with an 
unencumbered mind. 

The Don had not seemed surprised when Hagen returned 
from California late Tuesday evening and told him the results 
of the negotiations with Woltz. He had made Hagen go over 
every detail and grimaced with distaste when Hagen told about 
the beautiful little girl and her mother. He had murmured 
^ inf amiia \ his strongest disapproval. He had asked Hagen one 
final question. ^Does this man have real balls?’ 

Hagen considered exactly what the Don meant by this 
question. Over the years he had learned that the Don’s values 

66 



were so different from those of most people that his words also 
could have a different meaning. Did Woltz have character? 
Did he have a strong will ? He most certainly did, but that was 
not what the Don was asking. Did the movie producer have 
the courage not to be bluffed? Did he have the willingness to 
suffer heavy financial loss delay on his movies would mean, 
the scandal of his big star exposed as a user of heroin? Again 
the answer was yes. But again this was not what the Don 
meant. Finally Hagen translated the question properly in his 
mind. Did Jack Woltz have the balls to risk everything, to run 
the chance of losing all on a matter of principle, on a matter of 
honour; for revenge? 

Hagen smiled. He did it rarely but now he could not resist 
jesting with the Don. ‘ You*re asking if he is a Sicilian.* Tlic 
Don nodded his head pleasantly, acknowledging the flattering 
witticism and its truth. *No,* Hagen said. 

That had been all. The Don had pondered the question until 
the next day. On Wednesday afternoon he had called Hagen to 
his home and given him his instructions. The instructions liad 
consumed the rest of Hagen’s working day and left him dazed 
with admiration. There was no question in his mind that the 
Don had solved the problem, that Woltz would call him this 
morning with the news that Johnny Fontane had the starring 
part in his new war movie. 

At that moment the phone did ring but it was Amerigo 
Bonasera. The undertaker’s voice was trembling with grati- 
tude. He wanted Hagen to convey to the Don his undying 
friendship. The Don had only to call on him. He, Amerigo 
Bonasera, would lay down his life for the blessed Godfather. 
Hagen assured him that the Don would be told. 

The Daily News had carried a middle-page spread of Jerry 
Wagner and Kevin Moonan lying in the street. The photos 
were expertly gruesome, they seemed to be pulps of human 
beings. Miraculously, said the News^ they were both still alive 
though they would both be in the hospital for months and 
would require plastic surgery. Hagen made a note to tell 
Qemenza that something should be done for Paulie Gatto. He 
seemed to know his job. 

Hagen worked quickly and efficiently for the next three 

67 



hours qonsolidating eaming reports £com die Don’s teal estate 
company, his olive oil importing business, and his coostrucdon 
firm. None of them were doing well but with the war over 
they should all become rich producers. He had almost for- 
gotten the Johnny Fontane problem when his secretary told 
him Gilifornia was calling. He felt a little thrill of antidpadoo 
as he picked up the phone and said, * Hagen here. ’ 

The voice that came over the phone was unrecogniaable 
with hate and passion. * You fucking bastard,’ Woltz screamed. 
*ril have you all in jail for a hunted years. I’ll spend every 
penny 1 have to get you. I’ll get that Johnny Fontane’s balls 
cut oflf, do you hear me, you guinea fiick?’ 

Hagen said kindly, ‘I’m German-Irish.* There was a long 
pause and then a click of the phone being hung up. Hagen 
smiled. Not once had Woltz uttered a threat against Don 
Corleone himself. Genius had its rewards. 

Jack Woltz always slept alone. He had a bed big enough for 
ten people and a bedroom large enough for a movie ballroom 
scene, but he had slept alone since the death of his first wife 
ten years before. This did not mean he no longer used women. 
He was physically a vigorous man despite his age, but he could 
be aroused now only by very young girls and had learned that 
a few hours in the evening were all the youth of his body and 
his patience could tolerate. 

On this Thursday morning, for some reason, he awoke 
early. The light of ^wn made his huge bedroom as misty as 
a foggy meadow-land. Far down at the foot of his bed was 
a familiar shape and Woltz struggled up on his elbows to 
get a clearer look. It had the sl^pe of a horse’s head. Still 
groggy, Woltz reached and flicked on the night table lamp. 

The shock of what he saw made him physically ill. It 
seemed as if a great sledgehammer had struck him on the chest, 
his heartbeat jumped erratically and he became nauseous. His 
vomit spluttered on the thick flair rug. 

Severed from its body, the black silky head of the great 
horse Khartoum was stuck fast in a thick cake of blood. White 
reedy tendons showed. Froth covered the muzzle and those 
apple-sized eyes that had glinted Uke gold were mottled the 

68 



colour of rotdng fruit with dead, haemorrhaged blood. 
Woltz was struck by a purely animal terror and out of that 
terror he screamed for his servants and out of that terror he 
called Hagen to make his uncontrolled threats. His maniacal 
raving alarmed the butler, who called Woltz’s personal 
physician and his second in command at the studio. But Woltz 
regained his senses before they arrived. 

He had been profoundly shocked. What kind of man could 
destroy an animal worth six hundred thousand dollars? 
Without a word of warning. Without any negotiation to have 
the act, its order, countermanded. The ruthlessness, the sheer 
disregard for any \alue8, implied a man who considered him- 
self completely his owrt law, even his own God. And a man 
who backed up this kind of will with the power and cunning 
that held his own stable security force of no account. For by 
this time Woltz had learned that the horse’s body had ob- 
viously been heavily drugged before someone leisurely hacked 
the huge triangular head ofiF with an axe. The men on night 
duty claimed that they had heard nothing. To Woltz this 
seemed impossible. They could be made to talk. They had 
been bought off and they could be made to tell who had done 
the buying. 

Woltz was not a stupid man, he was merely a supremely 
egotistical one. He had mistaken the power he wielded in his 
world to be more potent than the power of Don Corleone. He 
had merely need^ some proof that this was not true. He 
understood this message. That despite all his wealth, despite 
all his contacts with the President of the United States, despite 
all his claims of friendship with the director of the FBI, an 
obscure importer of Italian olive oil would have him killed. 
Would actually have him killed! Because he wouldn’t give 
Johnny Fontane a movie part he wanted. It was incredible. 
People didn’t have any right to act that way. There couldn’t be 
any kind of world if people acted that way. It was insane. It 
meant you couldn’t do what you wanted with your own 
money, with the companies you owned, the power you had to 
give orders. It was ten times worse than communism. It had to 
be smashed. It must never be allowed. 

Woltz let the doctor give him a very mild sedation. It helped 

69 



him calm down again and to think sensibly. What really 
shocked him was the casualness with which this man Corleonc 
had ordered the destruction of a world-famous horse worth 
six hundred thousand dollars. Six hundred thousand dollars I 
And that was just for openers- Woltz shuddered. He thought 
of this life he had built up. He was rich. He could have the 
most beautiful women in the world by crooldng his finger and 
promising a contract. He w^as received by kings and queens. 
He lived a life as perfect as money and power could make it. 
It was crazy to risk all this because of a wliim. Maybe he could 
get to Corleone. What was the legal penalty for killing a race- 
horse? He laughed wildly and his doctor and servants watched 
him with nervous anxiety. Another thought occurred to him. 
He would be the laughingstock of California merely because 
someone had contemptuously defied his power in such 
arrogant fashion. That decided him. That and the thought 
that maybe, maybe they wouldn’ kill him. That they had 
something much more clever and painful in reserve. 

Woltz gave the necessary orders. His personal confidential 
staff swung into action. The servants and the doctor were 
sworn to secrecy on pain of incurring the studio and Woltz’s 
undying enmity. Word was given to the press that the race- 
horse Khartoum had died of an illness contracted during his 
shipment from England. Orders were given to bury the 
remains in a secret place on the estate. 

Six hours later Johnny Fontane received a phone call from 
the executive producer of the film telling him to report for 
work the following Monday. 

That evening, Hagen went to the Don’s house to prepare 
him for the important meeting the next day with Virgil 
Sollozzo. The Don had summoned his eldest son to attend, 
and Sonny Corleonc, his heavy Cupid-shaped face drawn with 
fatigue, w’as sipping at a glass of water. He must still be hump- 
ing that maid of honour, Hagen thought. Another worry. 

Don Corleone settled into an armchair puffing his Di Nobili 
cigar. Hagen kept a box of them in his room. He had tried to 
get the Don to switch to Havanas but the Don claimed they 
hurt his throat. 


70 



*Do we know everything necessary for us to know?* the 
Don asked. 

Hagen opened the folder that held his notes. The notes were 
in no way incriminating, merely cryptic reminders to make 
sure he touched on every important detail. ‘S0II0220 is coming 
to us for help/ Hagen said. ‘He will ask the family to put up at 
least a million dollars and to promise some sort of immunity 
from the law. For that we get a piece of the action, nobody 
knows how much. S0II0Z20 is vouched for by the Tattaglia 
family and they may have a piece of the action. The action is 
narcotics. Sollozzo has the contacts in Turkey, where they 
grow the poppy. From there he ships to Sicily. No trouble. In 
Sicily he has the plant to process into heroin. He has safety- 
valve operations to bring it down to morphine and bring it up 
to heroin if necessary. But it would seem that the processing 
plant in Sicily is pfotected in every way. The only hitch is 
bringing it into this country, and then distribution. Also initial 
capital. A million dollars cash doesn't grow on trees.* Hagen 
saw Don Corleone grimace. The old man hated unnecessary 
flourishes in business matters. He went on hastily. 

‘They call Sollozzo the Turk. Two reasons. He*s spent a lot 
of time in Turkey and is supposed to have a Turkish wife and 
kids. Second. He’s supposed to be very quick with the knife, or 
was, when he was young. Only in matters of business, though, 
and with some sort of reasonable complaint. A very compe- 
tent man and his own boss. He has a record, he’s done two 
terms in prison, one in Italy, one in the United States, and he’s 
known to the authorities as a narcotics man. This could be a 
plus for us. It means that he’ll never get immunity to testify, 
since he’s considered the top and, of course, because of his 
record. Also he has an American wife and three c*hildrcn and 
be is a good family man. He’ll stand still for any rap as long as 
he knows that they will be well taken care of for living 
money.’ 

The Don puffed on his cigar and said, ‘Santino, what do 
you think?* 

Hagen knew what Sonny would say. Sonny was chafing at 
being under the Don’s thumb. He wanted a big operation of 
his own. Something like this would be perfect. 


71 



Sonny took a long slug of Scotch. *Thctc*8 a lot of money 
in that white powder/ he said. *But it could be dangerous. 
Some people could wind up in jail for twenty years. I’d say that 
if we kept out of the operations end, just stuck to protection 
and financing, it might be a good idea.’ 

Hagen looked at Sonny approvingly. He had played his 
cards well. He had stuck to the obvious, much the best course 
for him. 

The Don puffed on his cigar. ‘And you, Tom, what do you 
think?’ 

Hagen composed himself to be absolutely honest. He had 
already come to the conclusion that the Don would refuse 
Sollozzo’s proposition. But what was worse, Hagen was con- 
vinced that for one of the few times in his experience, the Don 
had not thought things through. He was not looking far 
enough ahead. 

‘Go ahead, Tom,’ the Don said encouragingly. ‘Not even a 
Sicilian Consigliori always agrees with the boss.* I'hey all 
laughed. 

‘I think you should say yes,’ Hagen said. ‘You know^ all the 
obvious reasons. But the most important one is this. There is 
more money potential in narcotics than in any other business. 
If we don’t get into it, somebody else will, maybe the Tattaglia 
family. With the revenue they earn they can amass more and 
more police and political power. Their family will become 
stronger than ours. Eventually they will come after us to take 
away what wc have. It’s just like countries. If they arm, we 
have to arm. If they become stronger economically, they 
become a threat to us. Now we have the gambling and we have 
the unions and right now they are the best things to have. But 
I think narcotics is the coming thing. I think we have to have a 
piece of that action or we risk everything we have. Not now, 
but maybe ten years from now.’ 

The Don seemed enormously impressed. He puffed on his 
cigar and murmured, ‘ITiat’s the most important thing of 
course.’ He sighed and got to his feet. ‘What time do I have to 
meet this infidel tomorrow?’ 

Hagen said hopefully, ‘He’ll be here at ten in the morning.’ 
Maybe the Don would go for it. 



*1’11 want you both here with me/ the Don said. He rose, 
stretching, and took his son by the arm. ^Santino, get some 
sleep tonight, you look like t^ devil himself. Take care of 
yourself, you won*t be young forever.* 

Sonny, encouraged by this sign of fatherly concern, asked 
the question Hagen did not dare to ask. ‘Pop, what*8 your 
answer going to be?* 

Don Corleone smiled. ‘How do I know until I hear the 
percentages and other details? Besides I have to have time to 
think over the advice given here tonight. After all, l*m not a 
man who does things rashly.* As he went out the doot he said 
casually to Hagen, ‘Do you have in your notes that the Turk 
made his living from prostitution before the war? As the 
Tattaglia family does now. Write that down before you for- 
get.* There was just a touch of derision in the Don’s voice and 
Hagen flushed. He had deliberately not mentioned it, legiti- 
mately so since it really had no be^ing, but he had feared it 
might prejudice the Don’s decision. He was notoriously 
straitlaced in matters of sex. 

Virgil ‘the Turk* Sollozzo was a powerfully built, medium- 
sized man of dark complexion who could have been taken for 
a true Turk. He had a scimitar of a nose and cruel black eyes. 
He also had an impressive dignity. 

Sonny Corleone met him at the door and brought him into 
the oflice where Hagen and the Don waited. Hagen thought he 
had never seen a more dangerous-looking man except for 
Luca Brasi. 

There were polite handshakings all around. If the Don ever 
asks me if this mao has balls, 1 would have to answer yes, 
Hagen thought. He had never seen such force in ohe man, not 
even the Don. In fset the Don appeared at his worst. He was 
being a little too simple, a little too peasantlike in his greeting. 

Sollozzo came to the point immediately. The business was 
narcotics. Everything was set up. Certain poppy fields in 
Turkey had pledged him certain amounts every year. He had a 
prof&ected plant in France to convert into morphine. He had an 
absolutely secure plant in Sicily to process into heroin. 
Smuggling into hcih countries was as positively safe as such 


75 



matters could be. Entry into the United States would entail 
about five per cent losses since the FBI itself was incorruptible, 
as they both knew. But the profits would be enormous, the 
risk nonexistent. 

*Then why do you come to me?’ the Don asked politely. 
*How have I deserved your generosity?’ 

Sollozzo’s dark face remained impassive. ‘I need two 
million dollars cash,’ he said. ‘Equally important, I need a man 
who has powerful friends in the important places. Some of my 
couriers will be caught over the years. That is jncviiable. They 
will all have clean records, that I promise. So it will be logical 
for judges to give light sentences. 1 need a friend w^ho can 
guarantee that when my people get in trouble they won’t 
spend more than, a year or two in jail. Then thev won’t talk. 
But if they get ten and twenty \ cars, ^ho know In this wc rid 
there are many weak individuals. They may talk, they may 
jeopardize more important people. I ega) protection is a must. 
I hear, Don Corleonc, tho. voa have as many judges in your 
pocket as a bootblack has {ULces of silver.’ 

Don Corlcone didn’t bother U > acknowledge the compliment. 
‘What percentage for my family?’ he asked. 

SoDoz/o’s eyes gleamed. ‘Fifty per cent.’ He paused and 
then said in a voice t!ut was almost a caress, ‘In the first year 
your share would be three or four million dollars. Then it 
would go up.’ 

Don ("orleone said, ‘And what is the percentage of the 
Tatiagha family?’ 

For the first linic Sollozzo seemed to be nervous. ‘They will 
receive soriicthing from my share. I need some help in the 
operations.' 

‘ So,’ Don Corleonc said, ‘I receive fifty per cent merely for 
finance and legal protection. I have no worries about opera- 
tions, is that what you tell me?’ 

Sollozzo nodded. ‘If you think two million dollars in cash is 
“merely finance”, I congratulate you, Don Corleone.’ 

The Don said quietly, ‘I consented to see you out of my 
respect for the Tattaglias and because I’ve heard you arc a 
serious man to be treated also with respect. I must say no to 
you but I must give you my reasons. The profits in your 


74 



business are huge but so are the risks. Your operation, if 1 were 
part of it, could damage my other interests. It’s true I have 
many, many friends in politics, but they would not be so ’ 
friendly if my business were narcotics instead of gambling. 
They think gambling is something like liquor, a harmless 
vice, and they think narcotics a dirty business. No, don’t 
protest. I’m telling you their thoughts, not mine. How a man 
makes his living is not my concern. And what I am telling you 
is that this business of yours is too risky. All the members of 
my family have lived well the last ten years, without danger, 
without harm, I can’t endanger them or their livelihoods out 
of greed.’ 

The only sign of Soilozzo’s disappointment was a quick 
flickering of his eyes around the room, as if he hoped Hagen 
or Sonny would speak in his support. Then he said, ‘Are you 
worried about security for your two million?’ 

The Don smiled coldly. ‘No,* he said. 

S0II0220 tried again. ‘The Tattaglia family will guarantee 
your investment also.’ 

It was then tluit Sonny Corleone made an unforgivable error 
in judgement and procedure. He said eagerly, ‘The Tattaglia 
family guarantees the return of our investment without any 
percentage from us?’ 

Hagen was horrified at this break. He saw the Don turn 
cold, malevolent eyes on his eldest son, who froze in uncom- 
prehending dismay. Sollozzo’s eyes flickered again but this 
time with satisfaction. He had discovered a chink in the Don’s 
fortress. When the Don spoke his voice held a dismissal. 
‘Young people arc greedy,* he said. ‘And today they have no 
manners. They interrupt their ciders. They meddle. But I have 
a sentimental weakness for my children and I have spoiled 
them. As you see. Signor S0II0220, my no is final. Let me say 
that I myself wish you good fortune in your business. It has no 
conflict with my own. I’m sorry that I had to disappoint you.’ 

Sollozzo bowed, shook the Don’s hand and let Hagen take 
him to his car outside. There was no expression on his face 
when he said goodbye to Hagen. 

Back in the room, Don Corleone asked Hagen, ‘What did 
you think of that man?’ 


75 



^He’s a Sicilian,’ Hagen said dryly. 

The Don nodded his head thoughtfully. Then he turned to 
his son and said gently, * Sahtino, never let anyone outside the 
family know what you are thinking. Never let them know 
what you have under your Bngernails. I think your brain is 
going soft from all that comedy you play with that young girl. 
Stop it and pay attention to business. Now get out of my 
sight.* 

Hagen saw the surprise on Sonny’s face, then anger at his 
Cither’s reproach. Did he really think the Don would be 
ignorant of his conquest, Hagen wondered. And did he really 
not know what a dangerous mistake he had made this morn- 
ing? If that were true, Hagen would never wish to be the 
Consigliori to the Don of Santino Corleone. 

Don Corleone waited until Sonny had left the room. Then 
he sank back into his leather armchair and motioned brus- 
quely for a drink. Hagen poured him a glass of anisette. The 
Don looked up at him. ‘ Send Luca Brasi to see me,’ he said. 

Three months later, Hagen hurried through the paper work 
in his city office hoping to leave early enough for some Christ- 
mas shopping for his wife and children. He was interrupted by 
a phone call from a Johnny Fontane bubbling wi^ high 
spirits. The picture had been shot, the rushes, whatever the 
hell they were, Hagen thought, were fabulous. He was sending 
the Don a present for Christmas that would knock his eyes 
out, he’d bring it himself but there were some little things to 
be done in the movie. He would have to stay out on the Coast. 
Hagen tried to conceal his impatience. Johnny Fontane’s 
charm had always been lost on him. But his interest was 
aroused. ‘What is it?’ he asked. Johnny Fontane chuckled and 
said, ‘I can’t tell, that’s the best part of a Christmas present.’ 
Hagen immediately lost all interest and finally managed, 
politely, to hang up. 

Ten minutes later his secretary told hi^n that Connie 
Corleone Was on the phone and wanted to'^ speak to him. 
Hagen sighed. As a young girl Connie had b^n nice, as a 
married woman she was a nuisance. She made complaints 
about her husband. She kept going home to visit her mother 

76 



for two or three days. AodGurloRliadwas tatningoattobea 
real loser. He had ^en fixed up with a nice little business and 
was running it into the ground. He was also drinking, whoring 
around, gambling, and beating his wife up occasionally. 
Connie hadn’t told her family about that but she had told 
Hagen. He wondered what new tale of woe she had for him 
now. 

But the Christmas spirit seemed to have cheered her up. She 
just wanted to ask Hagen what her father would really like for 
Christmas. And Sonny and Fred and Mike. She already knew 
what she would get her mother. Hagen made some sugges- 
tions, all of which she rejected as silly. Finally she let him go. 

When the phone rang again, Hagen threw his papers back 
into the basket. The hell with it. He’d leave. It never occurred 
to him to refuse to take the call, however. When his secretary 
told nim it was Michael Corleone he picked up the phone with 
pleasure. He had always liked Mike. 

*Tom,* Michael Corleone said, ‘I’m driving down to the 
city with Kay tomorrow. There’s something important I want 
to tell the old man before Christmas. Will he be home to- 
morrow night?’ 

^Surc,’ Hagen said. 'He’s not going out of town until after 
Christmas. Anything 1 can do for you?’ 

Michael was as closemouthed as his father. 'No,’ he said. *1 
guess rU see you Christmas, everybody is going to be out at 
Long Beach, right?’ 

'Right,’ Hagen said. He was amused when Mike hung up on 
him without any small talk. 

He told his secretary to call his wife and tell her he would be 
home a little late but to have some supper for him.* Outside the 
building he walked briskly downtown towards Macy’s. Some- 
one stepped in his way. To his surprise he saw it was SoUozao. 

SoUozzo took him by the arm and said quietly, ‘Don’t be 
frightened, I just want to talk to you.’ A car parked at the 
kerb suddenly had its door open. Sollozzo said urgently, ‘Get 
m, I want to talk to you.’ 

Hagen pulled his arm loose. He was sdil not alarmed, just 
irritated. ‘1 haven’t got time,’ he said. At that moment two 
men came up behind him. Hagen felt a sudden weakness in his 


77 



kgs. S0II0220 said softly, ‘Get in the car. If I wanted to kill 
you you’d be dead now. Trust me.’ 

Without a shred of trust Hagen got into the car. 

Michael Corleone had lied to Hagen. He was already in New 
York, and he had called from a room in the Hotel Pennsylvania 
less than ten blocks away. Wl^.cn he hung up the phone, Kay 
Adams put out her cigarette and said, ‘Mike, what a good 
fibber you are.* 

Michael sat down beside her on the bed. ‘All for you, 
honey ; if I told my family wc were in town we*d have to go 
there right away. Then we couldn’t go out to dinner, we 
couldn’t go to the theatre, and we couldn’t sleep together 
tonight. Not in my father’s house, not when we’re not 
married.* He put his arms around her and kissed her gently on 
the lips. Her mouth was sweet and he gently pulled her down 
on the bed. She closed her eyes, waiting for him to make love 
to her and Michael felt an enormous happiness. He had spent 
the war years fighting in the Pacific, and on those bloody 
islands he had dreamed of a girl like Kay Adams. Of a beauty 
like hers, A fair and fragile body, milky-skinned and electri- 
fied by passion. She opened her eyes and then pulled his head 
down to kiss him. They made love until it was time for dinner 
and the theatre. 

After dinner they walked past the brightly-lit department 
stores full of holiday shoppers and Michael said to her, ‘What 
shall 1 get you for Christmas?’ 

She pressed against him. ‘Just you,’ she said. ‘Do you think 
your father will approve of me?’ 

Michael said gently, ‘That’s not really the question. Will 
your parents approve of me?’ 

Kay shrugged. ‘I don’t care,’ she said. 

Michael said, ‘1 even thought of changing my name, 
legally, but if something happened, that wouldn’t really help. 
You sure you want to be a Corleone?’ He said it only half- 
jokingly. 

‘Yes,’ she said without smiling. They pressed against each 
other. They had decided to get married during Christmas 
week, a quiet civil ceremony at City Hall with just two friends 

78 



as witnesses. But Michael had insisted he must tell his father. 
He had explained that his father would not object in any way 
as long as it was not done in secrecy. Kay was doubtful. She 
said she could not tell her parents until after the marriage. *Of 
course they’ll think I’m pregnant,’ she said. Michael grinned. 

* So will my parents,’ he said. 

What neither of them mentioned was the fact that Michael 
would have to cut his close ties with his family. They both 
understood that Michael had already done so to some extent 
and yet they both felt guilty about this fact. Tliey planned to 
finish college, seeing each other weekends and living together 
during summer vacations. It seemed like a happy life. 

The play was a musical called Carousel and its sentimental 
story of a braggart thief made them smile at each other with 
amusement. When they came out of the theatre it had turned 
cold. Kay snuggled up to him and said, ‘After we’re married, 
will you beat me and then steal a star for a present?’ 

Michael laughed. ‘I’m going to be a mathematics professor,’ 
he said. Then he asked, ‘Do you want something to eat before 
we go to the hotel?’ 

liy shook her head. She looked up at him meaningfully. As 
always he was touched by her eagerness to make love. He 
smiled down at her, and they kissed in the cold street. Michael 
felt hungry, and he decided to order sandwiches sent up to the 
room. 

In the hotel lobby Michael pushed Kay towards the news- 
stand and said, ‘Get the papers while I get the key.’ He had to 
wait in a small line; the hotel was still short of help despite the 
end of the war. Michael got his room key and looked around 
impatiently for Kay. She was standing by the 'news-stand, 
staring down at a newspaper she held in her hand. He walked 
towards her. She looked up at him. Her eyes were filled with 
tears. ‘Oh, Mike,’ she said, ‘oh, Mike.’ He took the paper 
from her hands. The first thing he saw was a photo of his 
father lying in the street, his head in a pool of blood. A man 
was sitting on the kerb weeping like a child. It was his 
brother Freddie. Michael Corleone felt his body turning to 
ice. There was no grief, no fear, just cold rage. He said to Kay, 
‘Go up to the room.’ But he had to take her by the arm and 


79 



lead her into the elevator. They rode up together in silence. In 
their room^ Michael sat down on the bed and opened the 
paper. The headlines said, vito corleoke shot, alleged 

RACKET CHIEF CRITICALLY WOUNDED. OPERATED ON 
UNDER HEAVY POLICE GUARD. BLOODY MOB WAR 
FEARED. 

Michael felt the weakness in his legs. He said to Kay, ‘He’s 
not dead, the bastards didn’t kill him.’ He read the story again. 
His father had been shot at five in the afternoon. That meant 
that while he had been making love to Kay, having dinner, 
enjoying the theatre, his father was near death. Michael felt 
sick with guilt. 

Kay said, ‘Shall v/e go down to the hospital now?’ 

Michael shook his head. ‘Let me call the house first. The 
people who cid this are cra 2 y and now that the old man’s still 
alive they’ll be desperate. Who the hell knows what thcy’U 
pull next.’ 

Both phones in the Long Beach house were busy and it was 
almost twenty minutes before Michael could get through. He 
heard Sonny’s voice saying, ‘Yeah.’ 

‘ Sonny, it’s me,’ Michael said. 

He could hear the relief in Sonny’s voice. ‘Jesus, kid, you 
had us worried. VCT?ere the hell are you? T’vc sent people to 
that hick town of yours to see what happened .’ 

‘How’s the old man?’ Michael said. ‘How bad is he hurt?’ 

‘Pretty bad,’ Sonny said. ‘They shot him five times. But he’s 
tough.’ Sonny’s voice was proud. ‘The doctors said he’ll pull 
through. Listen, kid, I’m busy, I can’t talk, where are you?’ 

‘In New York,’ Michael said. ‘Didn’t Tom tell you I was 
coming down?’ 

Sonny’s voice dropped a little. ‘They’ve snatched Tom. 
That’s why I was worried about you. His wife is here. She 
don’t know and neither do the cops. I don’t want them to 
know. The bastards who pulled this must he crazy. I want you 
to get out here right away and keep your mouth shut. OK?’ 

‘OK,’ Mike said, ‘do you know who did it?’ 

‘Sure,’ Sonny said. ‘And as soon as Luca Brasi checks in 
they’re gonna he dead meat. We still have all the horses.* 

‘I’ll be out in an hour/ Mike said. ‘In a cab/ He hung up. 

8o 



The papers had been oa the streets {be over three hoars. There 
must have been radio news reports. It was almost impossible 
that Luca hadn’t heard the news. Thoughtfully Michael 
pondered the question. Where was Luca Brasi? It was the 
same question ^t Hagen was asking himself at that moment. 
It was the same question that was worrying Sonny Codeone 
out in Long Beach. 

At a quarter to five that afternoon, Don Corleone had 
finished checking the papers the office manager of his olive oil 
company had prepared for him. He put on his jacket and 
rapp^ his knuckles on his son Freddie’s head to make him 
take his nose out of the afternoon newspaper. *Tell Gatto to 
get the car from the lot/ he said. *ril be ready to go home in a 
few minutes.’ 

Freddie grunted. ’I’ll have to get it myself. Paulie called in 
sick this morning. Got a cold again.’ 

Don Corleone looked thoughtful for a moment. ’That’s Ae 
third time this month. I think maybe you’d better get a 
healthier fellow for this job. Tell Tom.’ 

Fred protested. ’PauUe’s a good kid. If he says he’s sick, he’s 
sick. I don’t mind getting the car.’ He left the office. Don 
Corleone watched out the window as his son crossed Ninth 
Avenue to the parking lot. He stopped to call Hagen’s office 
but there was no answer. He called the house at Long Beach 
but again there was no answer. Irritsted, he looked out the 
window. His car was parked at the kerb in front of bis build- 
ing. Freddie was leaning against the fender, arms folded, 
watching the throng of Christmas shoppers. Don Corleone 
put on his jacket. The office manager helped him with his 
overcoat. Don Corleone grunted his thanks and went out the 
door and started down the two flights of steps. 

Out in the street the early winter light was Bdling. Freddie 
leaned casuaUy against the fmder of the heavy Buick. When he 
saw his father come out of the building Freddie went out Into 
the street to the driver’s side of the car and got in. Don 
Corleone was about to get in on the sidewalk side of the car 
when he hesitated and then turned back to the long open fhiit 
stand near the comer, lliis had been Us habit latcfy, he loved 

it 



the big out-of-season fruits, yellow peaches and oranges, that 
glowed in their green boxes. The proprietor sprang to serve 
him. Don Corleone did not handle the fruit. He pointed. The 
fruit man disputed his decisions only once, to show him that 
one of his choices had a rotten underside. Don Corleone took 
the paper bag in his left hand and paid the man with a five- 
dollar bill. He took his change and, as he turned to go back to 
the waiting car, two men stepped from around the corner. 
Don Corleone knew immediately what was to happen. 

The two men wore black overcoats and black hats pulled 
low to prevent identification by witnesses. They had not 
expected Don Corleone’s alert reaction. He dropped the bag of 
fruit and darted towards the parked car with startling quickness 
for a man of his bulk. At the same time he shouted, ‘ Fredo, 
Fredo. * It was only then that the two men drew their guns and 
fired. 

The first bullet caught Don Corleone in the back. He felt the 
hammer shock of its impact but made his body move towards 
the car. The next two bullets hit him in the buttocks and sent 
him sprawling in the middle of the street. Meanwhile the two 
gunmen, careful not to slip on the roiling fruit, staited to 
follow in order to finish him off. At that moment, perhaps no 
more than five seconds after the Don’s call to his son, Frede- 
rico Corleone appeared out of his car, looming over it. The 
gunmen fired two more hasty shots at the Don lying in the 
gutter. One hit him in the fleshy part of his arm and the second 
hit him in the calf of his right leg. Though these wounds were 
the least serious they bled profusely, forming small pools of 
blood beside his body- But by this time Don Corleone had lost 
consciousness. 

Freddie had heard his father shout, calling him by his child- 
hood name, and then he had heard the first two loud reports. 
By the time he got out of the car he was in shock, he had not 
even drawn his gun. The tw^o assassins could easily have shot 
him down. But they too panicked. They must have known the 
son was armed, and besides too much time had passed. They 
disappeared around the corner, leaving Freddie alone in the 
street with his father’s bleeding body. Many of the people 
thronging the avenue had flung themselves into doorways 



or on the ground, others had huddled together in small 
groups, 

Fr^dic still had not drawn his weapon. He seemed stunned. 
He stared down at his father’s body lying face down on the 
tarred street, lying now in what seemed to him a blackish lake 
of blood. Freddie went into physical shock. People eddied out 
again and someone, seeing him start to sag, led him to the 
kerbstone and made him sit down on it. A crowd gathered 
around Don Corleone’s body, a circle that shattered when the 
first police car sirened a path through them. Directly behind 
the police was the Daily News radio car and even before it 
stopped a photographer jumped out to snap pictures of the 
bleeding Don Corleone. A few moments later an ambulance 
arrived. Tlic photographer turned his attention to Freddie 
Corleone, who was now weeping openly, and this was a 
curiously comical sight, because of his tough, Cupid-fcatured 
face, heavy nose and thick mouth smeared with snot. Detec- 
tives were spreading through the crowd and more police cars 
were coming up. One detective knelt beside Freddie, ques- 
tioning him, but Freddie was too deep in shock to answer. The 
detective reached inside Freddie’s coat and lifted his wallet. 
He looked at the identification inside and whistled to his 
partner. In just a few seconds Freddie had been cut o£f from 
the crowd by a flock of plainclothesmcn. The first detective 
found Freddie’s gun in its shoulder holster and took it. Then 
they lifted Freddie oflF his feet and shoved him into an un- 
marked car. A.S that car pulled away it was followed by the 
Dalfy News radio car. The photographer was still snapping 
pictures of everybody and everything. 

• 

In the half hour after the shooting of his father. Sonny 
Corleone received five phone calls in rapid succession. The 
first was from Detective John Phillips, who was on the family 
payroll and had been in the lead car- of plainclothesmcn at the 
scene of the shooting. The first thing he said to Sonny over the 
phone was, ‘Do you recognize my voice?' 

‘Yeah,’ Sonny said. He was fresh from a nap, called to the 
phone by his wife. 

Phillips said quickly without preamble, ‘Somebody shot 

85 



your fiithet outside his pkoe. Fifteen minutes ago. He*s alive 
but hwt bad. They’ve n^en him to Fiench Hospital. They got 
your brother Freddie down at the Chelsea precdnct. You better 
get him a doctor when they turn him loose. I’m going down to 
the hospital now to help question your old man» if he can talk. 
I’ll keep you posted.’ . 

Across the table, Sonny’s wife Sandra noticed that her 
husband’s face had gone red with flushing blood. His eyes 
were glazed over. She whispered, ^What’s the matter?’ He 
waved at her impatiently to shut up, swung his body away so 
that his back was towards her and said into the phone, * You 
sure he’s alive?’ 

* Yeah, I’m sure,* the detective said. ‘A lot of blood but I 
think maybe he’s not as bad as he looks.* 

‘Thanka,’ Sonny said. ‘Be home tomorrow morning eight 
sharp. You got a grand coming.’ 

Sonny cradled the phone. He forced himself to sit sdll. He 
knew that his greatest weakness was his anger and this was one 
time when anger could be fatal. The first thing to do was get 
Tom Hagen. But before he could pick up the phone, it rang. 
The call was from the bookmaker licensed by the Family to 
operate in the district of the Don’s office. The bookmaker had 
called to tell him that the Don had been kiUed, shot dead in the 
street. After a few questions to make sure that the bookmaker’s 
informant had not been dose to the body. Sonny dismissed the 
information as incorrect. Phillips’ dope would be more 
accurate. The phone rang almost immediately a third time. It 
was a reporter from the Daily News. As soon as he identified 
himself. Sonny Corleone hung up. 

He dialled Hagen’s house and asked Hagen’s wife, ‘Did 
Tom come home yet?’ She said, ‘No,’ that he was not due for 
another twenty minutes but she expected him home for 
supper. ‘Have him call me,’ Sonny said. 

He tried to think things out. He tried to imagine how his 
father would react in a like situation. He had ^own imme- 
diately that this was an attack by SoUozzo, but Sollozzo would 
never have dared to eliminate so high-ranking a leader as the 
Don unless he was backed by other powerful people. The 
phone, ringing for the fourth dme, interrupted his droughts. 

84 



Tlie Toke oo the ocher end w«s very soft, very gende. 
^Sendno Codeone?* it tsked. 

*Yeah/ Sonny stuL 

* We have Tom Hagen/ the yolce said. 'In about three hours 
he*U be released with our proposidon. Don't do anything rash 
until you've heard what he has to say. You can only cause a lot 
of trouble. What's done is done. Everybody has to be sensible 
now. Don't lose that famous temper yours.' The voice was 
slightly mocking. Sonny couldn't be sure, but it sounded like 
Sollozzo. He made his voice sound muted, depressed. 'I’U 
wait/ he said. He heard the receiver on the other end dick. 
He k>oked at his heavy gold-banded wristwatch and noted 
the exact time of the call and jotted it down on the table- 
doth. 

He sat at the kitch^ table, frowning. His wife asked, 
*Sonny, what is it?' He told her calmly. 'They shot the old 
man.' ^en he saw the shock on her face he said roughly, 
'Don't worry, he’s not dead. And nothing else is going to 
happen.' He ^d not tell her about Hagen, ^d then the phone 
rang for the fifth time. 

It was Qemenza. The fat man's voice came wheeaing over 
the phone in gruntlike gasps. 'You hear about your father?' 
he asked. 

'Yeah,* Sonny said. 'But he’s not dead,’ There was a long 
pause over the phone and then Clemenxa's voice came packed 
with emotion, 'Thank God, thank God.' Then anxiously, 
'You sure? I got word he was dead in the street.' 

'He’s alive,’ Sonny said. He was listening intently to every 
intonation in Qemenza’s voice. The emotion had seemed 
genuine but it was part of the fat man's profession to be a good 
actor. 

'You'D have to carry the baD, Sonny,' Qemenza said. 'What 
do you want me to do?' 

'Get over to my father's house,’ Sonny said. 'Bring Paulie 
Gatto.' 

'That's aU?’ Gemenza asked. 'Don't you want me to send 
some people to the hospital and your place?' 

'No, 1 just want you and Paulie Gatto,' Sonny said. There 
was a long pause. Qemenza was getting the message. To make 



it a little more natural. Sonny asked, ‘Where the hell was 
Paulie anyway? What the hell was he doing?’ 

There was no longer any wheezing on the other end of the 
line. Clemcnza’s voice was guarded. ‘ Paulie was sick, he had a 
cold, so he stayed home. He’s been a little sick all winter,’ 

Sonny was instantly alert. ‘How many times did he stay 
home the last couple of months?’ 

‘Maybe three or four times,’ Clemenza said. ‘I always asked 
Freddie if he wanted another guy but he said no. There’s 
been no cause, the last ten years things been smooth, you 
know.’ 

‘Yeah,’ Sonny said. ‘I’ll see you at my father’s house. Be 
sure you bring Paulie. Pick him up on your way over. I don’t 
care how sick he is. You got that?’ He slammed down the 
phone without waiting for an answer. 

His wife was weeping silently. He stared at her for a 
moment, then said in a harsh voice, ‘Any of our people call, 
tell them to get me in my father’s house on his special phone. 
Anybody else call, you don’t know nothing. If Tom’s wife 
calls, tell her that Tom won’t be home for a while, he’s on 
business.’ 

He pondered for a moment. ‘A couple of our people will 
come to stay here.’ He saw her look of fright and said im- 
patiently, ‘You don’t have to be scared, I just want them 
here. Do whatever they tell you to do. If you wanta talk to me, 
get me on Pop’s special phone but don’t call me unless 
it’s really important. And don’t worry.’ He went out of the 
house. 

Darkness had fallen and the December wind whipped 
through the mall. Sonny had no fear about stepping out into 
the riight. All eight houses were owned by Don Corleone. At 
the mouth of the mall the two houses on either side vrere 
rented by family retainers with their own families and star 
boarders, single men who lived in the basement apartments. 
Of the remaining six houses that formed the rest of the half 
circle, one was inhabited by Tom Hagen and his family, his 
own, and the smallest and least ostentatious by the Don him- 
self. The other three houses were given rent-free to retired 
friends of the Don with the understanding that they would be 

86 



vacated whenever he requested. The harmless-looking mall 
was an impregnable fortress. 

All eight houses were equipped with floodlights which 
bathed the grounds around them and made the mall impossible 
to lurk in. Sonny went acrc;ss tiic street to his father’s house 
and let himself inside with his own key. He yelled out, ‘Ma, 
whcie are you?’ and his mother came out of the kitchen. 
Behind her rose the smell of frying peppers. Before she could 
say an3''thing. Sonny took her by the arm and made her sit 
down. ‘I just got a call,’ he said. ‘Now don’t get worried. 
Pop's in the hospital, he’s iiurt. Get dressed and get ready to 
get down there. I’ll have a car and a driver for you in a little 
while. OK?’ 

His mother looked at him steadily for a moment and then 
asked in Italian, ‘Have they shot him?’ 

Scjnny nodded. His mother bowed her head for a moment. 
I'hea she went back into the kitchen. Sonny followed her. He 
watched her turn off the gas under the panful of peppers and 
then go out and up to the bedroom. He took peppers from the 
pan and bread from the basket on the table and made a sloppy 
sand wichv^ with hot olive oil dripping from his fingers. He 
went into the huge corner room that wai, his father’s office and 
took the special phone from a locked cabinet box. The phone 
had been especially installed and was listed under a phony 
name and a phony address. The first person he called was Luca 
Brasi. There was no answer. Then he called the safety-valve 
caporegime in Brooklyn, a man of unquestioned loyalty to the 
Don. This man’s name was Tessio. Sonny told him what had 
happened and what he wanted. Tessio was to recruit fifty 
absolutely reliable men. He was to send guards to the hospital, 
he was to send men out to Long Beach to work there. Tessio 
asked, ‘Did they get Clemenza too?’ Sonny said, ‘I don’t want 
to use Clemcnza’s people right now.’ Tessio understood im- 
mediately, there was a pause, and then he said, ‘Excuse me. 
Sonny, I say this as your father would say it. Don’t move too 
fast. I can’t believe Clemenza would betray us.* 

‘Thanks,’ Sonny said. ‘I don’t think so but 1 have to be 
careful. Right?’ 

‘Right,’ Tessio said. 


87 



^Another thing/ Sonny said. *My kid brother Mike goes to 
college in Hanover, New Hampshire. Get some people we 
know in Boston to go up and get him and bring him down 
here to the house un^ this blows over. I’ll call him up so he’ll 
expect them. Again I’m just playing the percentages, just to 
make sure.’ 

^OK/ Tessio said, ‘I’ll be over your father’s house as soon 
as I get things rolling. OK? You Imow my boys, right?’ 

‘Yeah,’ Sonny said. He hung up. He went over to a small 
wall safe and unlocked it. From it he took an indexed book 
bound in blue leather. He opened it to the T’s until he found 
the entry he was looking for. It read, ‘Ray Farrell $5,000 
Christmas Eve.’ This was followed by a telephone number. 
Sonny dialled the number and said, ‘Farrell?’ The man on the 
other end answered, ‘Yes.’ Sonny said, ‘This is Santino 
Corleone. I want you to do me a favour and I want you to do 
it right away. I want you to check two phone numbers and 
give me all the calls they got and all the calls they made for the 
last three months.’ He gave Farrell the number of Paulie 
Gatto’s home and Gemenza’s home. Then he said, ‘This is 
important. Get it to me before midnight and you’ll have an 
extra very Merry Christmas.’ 

Before he settled back to think things out he gave Luca 
Brasi’s number one more call. Again there was no answer. 
This worried him but he put it out of his mind. Luca would 
come to the house as soon as he heard the news. Sonny leaned 
back in the swivel chair. In an hour the house would be 
swarming with Family people and he would have to tell them 
all what to do, and now t^t he finally had time to think he 
realized how serious the situation was. It was the first challenge 
to the Corleone Family and their power in ten years. There was 
no doubt that SoUozzo was behind it, but he would never have 
dared attempt such a stroke unless he had support from at least 
one of the five great New York fiunilies. And that support 
must have come from the Tattaglias. Which meant a full-scale 
war or an unmediate settlement on SoUozzo’s terms. Sonny 
smiled grimly. The wily Turk had planned well but he had 
been unlucky. The old man was alive and so it was war. With 
Luca Brasi and the resources of the Co d eonc Family there 


88 



could be but one outcome. But again the nagging woiry. 
Where was Luca Biasi? 


CHAPTER THREE 


Counting the driver, there were four men in the car with 
Hagen. They put him in the back seat, in the middle of the two 
men who had come up behind him in the street. Solloazo sat 
up front. The man on Hagen’s right reached over across his 
body and tilted Hagen’s hat over his eyes so that he could not 
sec. ‘Don’t even move your pinkie,’ he said. 

It was a short ride, not more than twenty minutes and when 
they got out of the*car Hagen could not recognize the neigh- 
bourhood because darkness had fallen. They led him into a 
basement apartment and made him sit on a straight-backed 
kitchen chair. Sollozzo sat across the kitchen table from him. 
His dark face had a peculiarly vulterine look. 

‘I don’t want you to be afraid,’ he said. ‘I know you’re not 
in the muscle end of the Family. I want you to help the 
Corleones and 1 want you to help me.’ 

Hagen’s hands were shaking as he put a cigarette in his 
mouth. One of the men brought a bottle of rye to the table and 
gave him a slug of it in a china coffee cup. Hagen drank the 
fiery liquid gratefully. It steadied his h^ds and took the 
weakness out of his legs. 

‘Your boss is dead,’ SoUozzo said. He paused, surprised at 
the tears that sprang to Hagen’s eyes. Then he went on. ‘ We 
got him outside his office, in the street. As soon jis I got the 
word, I picked you up. You have to make the peace between 
me and Sonny.’ 

Hagen didn’t answer. He was surprised at his own grief. 
And the feeling of desolation mixed with his fear of 
death. S0II0220 was speaking again. ‘ Sonny was hot for my deal. 
Right? You know it’s the smart thing to do too. Narcotics is 
the coming thing. There’s so much money in it that everybody 
can get rich just in a couple of years. The Don was an old 

$9 



“Moustache Pete’\ his day was over but he didn’t know it. 
Now he’s dead, nothing can bring him back. I’m ready to 
make a new deal, I want you to talk Sonny into taking it.’ 

Magen said, ‘You haven’t got a chance. Sonny will come 
after you with everything he’s got.’ 

Sollozzo said impatiently, ‘That’s gonna be his first reaction. 
You have to talk some sense to him. The Tattaglia Family 
stand behind me with all their people. The other New York 
Families will go along with anything that will stop a full-scale 
war between us. Our war has to hurt them and their businesses. 
If Sonny goes along with the deal, the other Families in the 
country will consider it none of their afiair, even the Don’s 
oldest friends.* 

Hagen stared down at his hands, not answering. Sollozzo 
went on persuasively, ‘ The Don was slipping. In the old days 
I could never have^ot to him. The other Families distrust him 
because he made you his Consigiiori and you’re not even Italian, 
much less Sicilian. If it goes to all-out war the Corleone Family 
will be smashed and everybody loses, me included. I need the 
Family political contacts more than I need the money even. So 
talk to Sonny, talk to the caporegimes\ you’ll save a lot of blood- 
shed.’ 

Hagen held out his china cup for more whisky. ‘I’ll try,’ he 
said. ‘But Sonny is strong-headed. And even Sonny won’t be 
able to call off Luca. You have to worry about Luca. /V/have 
to worry about Luca if I go for your deal.’ 

Sollozzo said quietly, ‘I’ll take care of Luca. You take care 
of Sonny and the other two kids. Listen, you can tell them that 
Freddie would have got it today with his old man but my 
people had strict orders not to gun him. 1 didn’t want any 
more hard feelings than necessary. You can tell them that, 
Freddie is alive because of me.’ 

Finally Hagen’s mind was working. For the first time he 
really believed that Sollozzo did not mean to kill him or hold 
him as a hostage. The sudden relief from fear that flooded his 
body made him flush with shame. Sollozzo watched him with 
a quiet understanding smile. Hagen began to think things out. 
If he did not agree to argue Sollozzo’s case, he might be killed. 
But then he realized that Sollozzo expected him only to 


90 



present it and present it properly, as he was bound to do as a 
responsible Consigiiori. And now, thinking about it, he also 
realized that SoUozzo was right. An unlimited war between the 
Tattaglias and the Corleones must be avoided at all costs. The 
Corleones must bury their dead and forget, make a deal. And 
then when the time was right they could move against Sollozzo. 

But glancing up, he realized that Sollozzo knew exactly 
what he was thinking. The Turk was smiling. And then it 
struck Hagen. What had happened to Luca Brasi that Sollozzo 
was so unconcerned? Had Luca made a deal? He remembered 
that on the night Don Corleone had refused Sollozzo, Luca 
had been summoned into the office for a private conference 
with the Don. But now was not the time to worry about such 
details. He had to get back to the safety of the Corleone Family 
fortress in Long Beach. ‘TU do my best/ he said to Sollozzo. 
‘I believe you’re right, it’s even what the Don would want us 
to do.’ 

Sollozzo nodded gravely. ‘Fine,’ he said. ‘I don’t like blood- 
shed, I’m a businessman and blood costs too much money.’ 
At that moment the phone rang and one of the men sitting 
behind Hagen went to answer it. He listened and then said 
curtly, ‘OK, I’ll tell him.’ He hung up the phone, went to 
Sollozzo’s side and whispered in the Turk’s ear. Hagen saw 
Sollozzo’s face go pale, his eyes glitter with rage. He himself 
felt a thrill of fear. Sollozzo was looking at him speculatively 
and suddenly Hagen knew that he was no longer going to be 
set free. That something had happened that might mean his 
death. Sollozzo said, ‘ The old man is still alive. Five bullets in his 
Sicilian hide and he’s still alive.’ He gave a fatalistic shrug. ‘ Bad 
luck,' he said to Hagen. ‘Bad luck for me. Bad luck for you.’ 


CHAPTER FOUR 

Whkn Michael Corleone arrived at his father’s house in Long 
Beach he found the narrow entrance mouth of the mall 
blocked off with a link chain. The mall itself was bright with 

91 



the floodlights of all eight houses, outlining at least ten cars 
t>arked along the curving cement walk. 

Two men he didn't know were leaning against the chain. 
One of them asked in a Brooklyn accent, * Who'rc you?* 

He told them. Another man came out of the nearest house 
and peered at his face. * That’s the Don’s kid,* he said. *l’ll 
bring him inside.’ Mike followed this man to his father’s 
house, where two men at the door let him and his escort pass 
inside. 

The house seemed to be full of men he didn’t know, until he 
went into the living room. There Michael saw Tom Hagen’s 
wife, Theresa, sitting stiflly on the sofa, smoking a cigarette. 
On the coflee table in front of her was a glass of whisky. On 
the other side of the sofa sat the bulky Clememca. The eapm9- 
face was impassive, but he was sweating and the dgar 
in his hand glistened slickly black with his saliva. 

Gemenaa came to wri^g his hand in a consoling way, 
muttering, *Yout mother u at the hospital with your father, 
he’s going to be all right!* Paulie Gatto stood up to shake 
hands. Michael looked at him curiously. He knew Paulie was 
his father’s bodyguard hht did not know that Paulie had 
stayed home sick that day. But he sensed tension in the thin 
dark face. He knew Gatto’s reputation as an up-and-coming 
man, a very quick man who knew how to get delicate )obs 
done without complications, and today he had failed in his 
duty. He noticed several other men in the comers of the room 
but he did not recogniae them. They were not of Gemenaa’s 
people. Michael put these facts together and understood. 
Gemenza and Gatto were suspect. Thinking that Paulie had 
been at the scene, he asked the ferret-faced young man, *^How 
is Freddie? He OK?’ 

*The doctor gave him a shot,’ Gemenza said. ‘He’s sleep- 
ing.’ 

Michael went to Hagen’s wife and bent down to kiss her 
check. They had always liked each other. He whispered, 
‘Don’t worry, Tom will be OK. Have you talked to Sonny 
yet?’ 

Theresa clung to him for a moment and shook her head. 
She was a delicate, very pretty woman, more American than 


9 ^ 



Italian, and very scared. He took her hand and lifited her ofF die 
sofa. Then he led her into his father’s comet room office. 

Sonny was sprawled out in his chair behind the desk holding 
a yellow pad in one hand and a pencil in the other. The only 
other man in the room with him was the caporegrme Tessio, 
whom Michael recognized and immediately realized that it 
must be his men who were in the house and forming the new 
palace guard. He too had a pencil and pad in his hands. 

When Sonny saw them he came from behind his desk and 
took Hagen’s wife in his arms. ‘Don’t worry, Theresa,’ he 
said. ‘Tom’s OK. They just wanta give him die proposidon, 
they said they’d turn him loose. He’s not on the operating end, 
he’s just out lawyer. There’s no reason for anybody to do him 
harm.’ 

He released Theresa and then to Michael’s surprise he, too, 
got a hug and a kiss on the cheek. He pushed Sonny away and 
said grinning, ‘After I get used to you beating me up I gotta 
put up with this?’ They had often fought when they were 
younger. 

Sonny shrugged. ‘Listen, kid, I was worried when I couldn’t 
get ahold of you in that hick town. Not that I gave a crap if 
they knocked you ofif, but I didn’t like the idea of bringing the 
news to the old lady. 1 had to tell her about Pop.’ 

‘How’d she take it?’ Michael asked. 

‘Good,’ Sonny said. ‘She’s been through it before. Me too. 
You were too young to know about it and then things got 
pretty smooth while you were growing up.’ He paused and 
then said, ‘ She’s down at the hospital with the old man. He’s 
gonna pull through.’ 

‘How about us going down?’ Michael asked. 

Sonny shook his head and said dryly, ‘1 can’f leave this 
house until it’s all over.’ The phone rang. Sonny picked it up 
and listened intently, ^^liilc he was listening Michael sauntered 
over to the desk and glanced down at the yellow pad Sonny 
had been writing on. There was a list of seven names. The first 
three were Sollozzo, Phillip Tattaglia, and John Tattaglia. It 
struck Michael with full force that he had interrupted Sonny 
and Tessio as they were making up a list of men to be killed. 

When Sonny hung up the phone he said to Theresa Hagen 


93 



and Michael, *Can you two wait outside? I got some business 
with Tessio we have to finish/ 

Hagen’s wife said, ‘Was that call about Tom?’ She said it 
almost truculently but she was weeping with fright. Sonny put 
his arm around her and led her to the door. ‘I swear he’s 
going to be OK,’ he said. ‘Wait in the living room. I’ll come 
out as soon as I hear something.* He shut the door behind her. 
Michael had sat down in one of the big leather armchairs. 
Sonny gave him a quick sharp look and then went to sit do\^m 
behind the desk. 

‘You hang around me, Mike,* he said, ‘you’re gonna hear 
things you don’t wanta hear.’ 

Michael lit a cigarette. T can help out,’ he said. 

‘No, you can’t,’ Sonny said. ‘The old man would be sore as 
hell if I let you get mixed up in tliis.* 

Michael stood up and yelled. ‘You lousy bastard, he’s my 
father. I’m not supposed to help him? 1 can help. 1 don’t have 
to go out and kiil people but I can help. Stop treating me like a 
kid brother, 1 was in the war. I got shot, remember? I killed 
some Japs. What the hell do you think I’ll do w^hen you knock 
somebody off? Faint?’ 

Sonny grinned at him. ‘ Pretty soon you’ll want me to put up 
my dukes. OK, stick around, you can handle the phone.’ He 
turned to Tessio. ‘That call I just got gave me dope we 
needed.’ He turned to Michael. ‘Somebody had to finger the 
old man. It could have been Clemenza, it could have been 
Paulie Gatto, who was very conveniently sick today. I know 
the answer now, let’s see how smart you arc, Mike, you’re the 
college boy. V^lio sold out to S0U0220?’ 

Michael sat down again and relaxed back into the leather 
armchair. He thought everything over very carefully. Qc- 
men2a was a caporegime in the Corleone Family structure. Don 
Corleone had made him a millionaire and they had been inti- 
mate friends for over twenty years. He held one of the most 
powerful posts in the organization. What could Clemenza gain 
for betraying his Don? More money? He was rich enough but 
then men are always greedy. More power? Revenge for some 
fancied insult or slight? That Hagen had been made the 
Consiglhri? Or perhaps a businessman’s conviction that 


94 



Sollozzo would win out? No, it was impossible for Clcmcnza 
to be a traitor, and then Michael thought sadly it was only im- 
possible because he didn’t want Clemenza to die. The fat man 
had always brought him gifts when he was growing up, had 
sometimes taken him on outings when tbe Don had been too 
busy. He could not believe that Clemenza was guilty of 
treachery. 

But, on the other hand, Sollozzo would want Clemenza in 
his pocket more than any other man in the Corleone Family. 

Michael thought about Paulie Gatto. Paulie as yet had not 
become rich. He was well thought of, his rise in the organiza- 
tion was certain but he would have to put in liis time like 
everybody else. Also he would have wilder dreams of power, 
as the young always do. It had to be Paulie. And then Michael 
remembered that in tbe sixth grade he and Paulie had been in 
the same class in school and he didn’t want it to be Paulie 
cither. 

He shook his head. * Neither one of them,* be said. But he 
said it only because Sonny had said he had the answer. If it had 
been a vote, he would have voted Paulie guilty. 

Sonny was smiling at him. ‘Don’t worry,* he said. ‘Clemenza 
is OK. It’s Paulie.’ 

Michael could see that Tessio was rcUeved. As a fellow 
caporegime his sympathy would be with Clemenza. Also the 
present situation was not so serious if treachery did not reach 
so high. Tessio said cautiously, ‘Then I can send my people 
home tomorrow?’ 

Sonny said, ‘ The day after tomorrow. I don’t want anybody 
to know about this until then. Listen, I want to talk some 
family business with my brother, personal. Wai\ out in the 
living room, eh ? We can finish our list later. You and Clemenza 
will work together on it.’ 

‘Sure,’ Tessio said. He went out. 

‘How do you know for sure it’s Paulie?* Michael asked. 

Sonny said, ‘ We have people in the telephone company and 
they tracked down all of Paulic’s phone calls in and out. 
Clemenza’s too. On the three days Paulie was sick this 
month he got a call from a street booth across from tbe old 
man’s building. Today too. They were checking to see if 

9J 



Paulie was coming down or somebody was being sent down to 
take his place. Or for some other reason. It doesn’t matter.’ 
Sonny shrugged. * Thank God it was Paulie. We’ll need 
Clemenza bad.’ 

Michael asked hesitantly^ ‘Is it going to be an all-out war?* 

Sonny’s eyes were hard. ‘That’s how I’m going to play it as 
soon as Tom checks in. Until the old man tells me different.’ 

Michael asked, ‘ So why don’t you wait until the old man can 
tell you?’ 

Sonny looked at him curiously. ‘ How the hell did you win 
those combat medals? We are under the gun, man, we gotta 
fight. I’m just afraid they won’t let Tom go.* 

Michael was surprised at this. ‘Why not?’ 

Again Sonny’s voice was patient. ‘They snatched Tom 
because they figured the old man was finished and they could 
make a deal with me and Tom would be the sit-down guy in 
the preliminary stages, carry the proposition. Now with the 
old man alive they know I can’t make a deal so Tom’s no good 
to them. They can turn him loose or dump him, depending 
how Sollozzo feels. If they dump him, it would be just to show 
08 they really mean business, trying to bulldoze us.’ 

Michael said quiedy, ‘What made S0II0220 think he could 
get a deal with you?’ 

Sonny flushed and he didn’t answer for a moment. Then he 
said, ‘ We had a meeting a few months ago, S0II0Z20 came to 
us with a proposition on drugs. The old man turned him 
down. But during the meeting I shot off my mouth a little, I 
showed I wanted the deal. Which is absolutely the wrong 
thing to do; if there’s one thing the old man hammered into 
me it’s never to do a thing like that, to let other people know 
there*^ a split of opinion in the Family. So Sollozzo figures he 
gets rid of the old man, 1 have to go in with him on the drugs. 
With the old man gone, the Family power is cut at least in half. 
1 would be fighting for my life anyway to keep all the busi- 
nesses the old man got together. Drugs are the coming thing, 
we should get into it. And his knocking off the old man is 
purely business, nothing personal. As a matter of business 1 
would go in with him. Of course he would never let me get 
too close, he’d make sure I’d never get a clean shot at him, just 

96 



in case. But he also knows that once I accepted the deal the 
other Families would never let me start a war a couple of years 
later just for revenge. Also, the Tattaglia Family is behind 
him .* 

‘If they had got the old man, what would you have 
done?’ Michael asked. 

Sonny said very simply, * S0II0220 is dead meat. I don’t care 
what it costs. I don’t care if we have to fight all the five 
Families in New York. The Tattaglia Family is going to be 
wiped out. I don’t care if we all go down together.’ 

Michael said softly, ‘ That’s not how Pop would have played 
it.’ 

Sonny made a violent gesture. ‘I know I’m not the man he 
was. But I’ll tell you this and he’ll tell you too. When it comes 
to real action I can operate as good as anybody, short-range. 
S0II0220 knows that and so do Clemen2a and Tessio. 1 “made 
my bones ” when 1 was nineteen, the last time the Family had a 
war, and I was a big help to the old man. So I’m not worried 
now. And our Family has all the horses in a deal like this. I just 
wish we could get contact with Luca.’ 

Michael asked curiously, .‘Is Luca that tough, like they say? 
Is he that good?’ 

Sonny nodded. ‘He’s in a class by himself. I’m going to send 
him after the three Tattaglias. I’U get S0II0220 myself.’ 

Michael shifted uneasily in his chair. He looked at his older 
brother. He remembered Sonny as being sometimes casually 
brutal but essentially warmhearted. A nice guy. It seemed 
unnatural to hear him talking this way, it was chilling to see 
the list of names he had scribbled down, men to be executed, 
as if he were some newly crowned Roman Emperor. He was 
glad-that he was not truly part of all this, that novc his father 
lived he did not have to involve himself in vengeance. He’d 
help out, answering the phone, running errands and messages. 
Sonny and the old man could take care of themselves,. especi- 
ally with Luca behind them. 

At that moment they heard a woman scream in the living 
room. Oh, Christ, Michael thought, it sounded like Tom’s 
wife. He rushed to the door and opened it. Everybody In the 
living foom was standing. And by the sofe Tom Hagen was 

97 

God&ther— 4 



holding Theresa close to him, his face embarrassed. Theresa 
was weeping and sobbing, and Michael realized that the 
scream he had heard had been her calling out her husband’s 
name with joy. As he watched, Tom Hagen disentangled him- 
self from his wife’s arms and lowered her back onto the sofa. 
He smiled at Michael grimly. ‘Glad to sec you, Mike, really 
glad.’ He strode into the office without another look at his 
still -sobbing wife. He hadn’t lived with the Corleone Familv 
ten years for nothing, Michael thought with a queer flush 
of pride. Some of the old man had rubbed off on him, as it 
had on Sonny, and he thought, with surprise, even on 
himself. 


CHAPTER FIVE 


It w AS nearly four o’clock in the morning as they all sat in the 
corner room office - Sonny, Michael, Tom Hagen, Clemenza, 
and Tcssio. Theresa Hagen had been persuaded to go to her 
own home next door. Paulie Gatto was still waiting in the 
living room, not knowing that Tessio’s men had been in- 
structed not to let him leave or let him out of their sight. 

Tom Hagen relayed the deal SoUozzo oflercd. He told how 
after SoUozzo had learned the Don still lived, it was obvious 
that he meant to kiU Hagen, Hagen grinned. ‘If I ever plead 
before the Supreme Court, I’ll never plead better than I did 
with that goddamn Turk tonight. I told him I’d talk the 
Family into the deal even though the Don was alive. I told 
him I could wrap you around ray finger. Sonny. How we were 
buddies as kids; and don’t get sore, but I let him get the idea 
that maybe you weren’t too sorry about getting the old man’s 
job, God forgive me.’ He smiled apologetically at Sonny, who 
made a gesture signifying that he understood, that it was of no 
consequence. 

Michael, leaning back in his armchair with the phone at his 
right hand, studied both men. When Hagen had entered the 

98 



room Sonny had come rushing to embrace him. Michael 
realized with a faint twinge of jealousy that in many ways 
Sonny and Tom Hagen were closer than he himself could ever 
be to his own brother. 

* Let’s get down to business/ Sonny said. * We have to make 
plans. Take a look at this list me and Tessio made up. Tessio, 
give Clemenza your copy.’ 

‘If we make plans/ Michael said, 'Freddie should be here.’ 

Sonny said grimly, ‘Freddie is no use to us. The doctor 
says he’s in shock so bad he has to have complete rest. 1 don’t 
understand that. Freddie was always a pretty tough guy. 1 
guess seeing the old man gunned down was hard on him, he 
always thought the Don was God. He wasn’t like you and me, 
Mike.’ 

Hagen said quickly, ‘ O K, leave Freddie out. Leave him out 
of everything, absolutely everything. Now, Sonny, until this 
is all over I think you should stay in the house. 1 mean never 
leave it. You’re safe here. Don’t underrate Sollozzo, he’s got 
to be a pe^pfiovantt^ a real .90 calibre. Is the hospital covered?’ 

Sonny nodded. ‘The cops have it locked in and I got my 
people there visiting Pop all the time. What do you think of 
that list, Tom?’ 

Hagen frowned down at the list of names. ‘Jesus Christ, 
Sonny, you’re really taking this personal. The Don would 
consider it a purely business dispute. Sollozzo is the key. Get 
rid of Sollozzo and everything fdls in line. You don’t have to 
go after the Tattaglias.’ 

Sonny looked at his two caporegimes. Tessio shrugged. ‘It’s 
tricky,’ he said. Qemenza didn’t answer at all. 

Sonny said to Qemenza, ‘One thing w'e can tgke care of 
without discussion. I don’t want Paulie around here any more. 
Make that first on your list.’ The fat caporegime nodded. 

Hagen said, '\^at about Luca? Sollozzo didn’t seem 
worried about Luca. That worries me. If Luca sold us out, we’re 
in real trouble. That’s the first thing we have to know. Has 
anybody been able to get in touch with him?’ 

‘No,’ Sonny said. ‘I’ve been calling him all night. Maybe 
he’s shacked up.* 

‘No,’ Hagen said. ‘He never sleeps over with a broad. He 

99 



always goes home when he’s thtoogli* M&e» keq> ringifig his 
number until you get an answer/ Michael dutifully picked up 
the phone and dialled. He could hear the phone ringing on tlK 
other end but no one answered. Finally he hung up. ‘Keep 
trying every fifteen minutes/ Hagen said. 

Sonny said impatiendy, ‘OK, Tom you’re the Consigiiori^ 
how about some advice? What the hell do you think we should 
do?’ 

Hagen helped himself to the whisky bottle on the desk. 
‘We negotiate with Solloazo tmtil your father is in shape to 
take charge. We might even make a deal if we have to. ^^en 
your hither gets out of bed he can setde the whole business 
without a fuss and all the Families will go along with him.’ 

Sonny said angrily, ‘You think 1 can’t handle this guy 
SoUozao?’ 

Tom Hagen looked him directly in the eye. ‘ Sonny, sure you 
can outfight him. The Corleone Family has the power. You 
have Clemenza and Tessio here and they can muster a thousand 
men if it comes to an all-out war. But at the end there will be a 
shambles over the whole East Coast and all the other Families 
will blame the Corleones. We’ll make a lot of enemies. And 
that’s something your father never believed in.’ 

Michael, watching Soimy, thought he took this well. But 
then Sonny said to Hagen, ‘What if the old man dies, what do 
you advise then, ConsiglioriV 

Hagen said quietly, ‘I know you won’t do it, but 1 would 
advise you to make a real deal with Sollozzo on the drugs. 
Without your father’s political contacts and personal influence 
the Corleone Family loses half its stieng^. Without your 
father, the other New York Families might wind up support- 
ing the Tattaglias and SoUozzo just to make sure there isn’t a 
long destructive war. If your father dies, make the deal. Then 
wait and see/ 

Sonny was white-faced with anger. ‘ That’s easy for you to 
say, it’s not your father they killed.’ 

Hagen said quickly and proudly, ‘1 was as good a son to 
him as you or Mike, maybe better. I’m giving you a profes- 
sional opinion. Personally I want to kill ail those basUrds.’ 
The emotion in his voice shamed Sonny, who said, ‘Oh, 


lOO 



Chritt, Tom, 1 didn’t mmn it that wmy* But he had, ceally. 
Blood was blood and nothing dte was its equal. 

Sonny brooded for a moment as the others waited in em* 
barrassed silence. Then he sighed and spoke quietly. ’OK, 
we’ll sit tight until the old man can give us the lead. But, Tom, 
1 want you to stay inside the mall, too. Don’t take any chances. 
Mike, you be careful, though I don’t think even SoUozao 
would bring personal family into the war. Everybody would 
be against him then. But be careful. Tessio, you hold your 
people in reserve but have them nosing around the city. Qe- 
menza, after you settle the Paulic Gatto thing, you move your 
men into the house and the mall to replace Tessio’s people. 
Tessio, you keep your men at the hospital, though. Tom, start 
negotiation over the phone or by messenger with SoUozzo and 
the Tattaglias the first thing in the morning. Mike, tomorrow 
you take a couple of Qemenza’s people and go to Luca’s house 
and wait for him to show up or find out where the hell he is. 
That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if 
he’s heard the news. 1 can’t believe he’d ever go against hia 
Ocm, no matter what the Turk ofiered him.’ 

Hagen said reluctantly, ’Maybe Mike shouldn’t get mised 
op in this so directly.’ 

’Right,’ Sonny said. ’Forget that, Mike. Anyway 1 need you 
on the phone here in the bouse, that’s more important.’ 

Michael didn’t say anything. He. felt awkward, almost 
ashamed, and he noticed Qemenza and Tessio with faces so 
carefully impassive ihat he was sure that they were hiding 
their contempt. He picked up the phone and dialled Luca 
Brasi’s numb^ and kept the receiver to his car as it rang and 
tang. 


CHAPTER SIX 

Peter Clemenz A slept badly thatnight. In the morning he got 
up early and made his own breakfast of a glass of grappa^ a 
thick slice of Genoa salami with a chunk of fresh Italian bread 


lOl 



that was still delivered to his door as in the old days. Then he 
drank a great, plain china mug filled with hot coffee that had 
been laced with anisette. But as he padded about the house in 
his old bathrobe and red felt slippers he pondered on the day’s 
work that lay ahead of him. Last night Sonny Corleone had 
made it very dear that Paulie Gatto was to be taken care of 
immediately. It had to be today. 

Clemenza was troubled. Not because Gatto had been his 
protege and had turned traitor. This did not reflect on the 
t,aporeffme*s judgement. After all, Paulie’s background had 
been perfect He came from a Sicilian family, he had grown up 
in the same neighbourhood as the Corleone children, had 
indeed even gone to school with one of the sons. He had been 
brought up through each levd in the proper manner. He had 
been tested and not found wanting. And then after he had 
'made his bones’ he had received a good living from the 
Family, a percentage of an East Side ‘ book ’ and a union pay- 
roll slot. Qemen2a had not been unaware that Paulie Gatto 
supplemented his income with freelance stick ups, strictly 
against the Family rules, but even this was a sign of the man’s 
worth. The breaking of such regulations was considered a 
sign of high-spiritedness, like that shown by a fine racing horse 
fighting the reins. 

And Paulie had never caused trouble with his stick ups. 
They had always been meticulously planned and carried out 
with the minimum of fuss and trouble, with no one ever get- 
ting hurt : a three-thousand-doUar Manhattan garment centre 
payroll, a small chinaware factory payroll in the slums of 
Brooklyn. After all, a young man could always use some extra 
pocket money. It was all in the pattern. Who could ever fore- 
tell that Paulie Gatto would turn traitor? 

What was troubling Peter Qemenza this morning was an 
administrative problem. The actual execution of Gatto was a 
cut-and-dried chore. The problem was, who should the 
caporegime bring up from the ranks to replace Gatto in the 
Family? It was an important promotion, that to ‘button’ man, 
one not to be handed out lightly. The man had to be tough and 
he had to be smart. He had to be safe, not a person that would 
talk to the police if he got in trouble, one well saturated in the 


102 



Sicilians’ law of omtrta^ the law of silence. And then, what kind 
of a living would he receive for his new duties ^ Clcmenza had 
several times spoken to the Don about better rewards for the 
all-important button man who was first in the front line when 
trouble arose, but the Don had put him off. If Paulic had been 
making more money, he might have been able to resist the 
blandishments of the wily Turk, Sollo2zo. 

Gemenza finally narrowed down the list of candidates to 
three men. The first was an enforcer who worked with the 
coloured policy bankers in Harlem, a big brawny brute of a 
man of great physical strength, a man with a great deal of 
personal charm who could get along with people and yet 
when necessary make them go in fear of him. But Gemenza 
scratched him off the list after considering his name for a half 
hour. This man got along too well with the black people, 
which hinted at some flaw of character. Also he would be too 
hard to replace in the position he now held. 

The second name Gemenza considered and almost settled 
on was a hard-working chap who served faithfully and well in 
the organization. This man was the collector of delinquent 
accounts for Family-licensed shylocks in Manhattan. He had 
started off as a bookmaker’s runner. But he was not quite yet 
ready for such an important promotion. 

Finally he settled on Rocco Lampone. Lampone had served 
a short but impressive apprenticeship in the Family. During 
thcL war he had been wounded in Africa and been discharged 
in 1943. Because of the shortage of young men, Gemenza had 
taken him on even though Lampone was partially incapaci- 
tated by his injuries and walked with a pronounced limp. Ge- 
menza had used him as a black-market contact in the garment 
centre and with government employees controlling OP A food 
stamps. From that, Lampone had graduated to troubleshooter 
for the whole operation. What Gemenza liked about him was 
his good judgement. He knew that there was no percentage in 
being tough about something that would only cost a heavy 
fine or six months in jail, small prices to pay for the enormous 
profits earned. He had the good sense to know that it was not 
an area for heavy threats but light ones. He kept the whole 
operation in a minor key, which was exactly what was needed. 



Qemenza fdt the relief of a conscientious administrator 
who has solved a knotty personnel problem. Yes, it would be 
Rocco Lampone who would assist. For Gemenza planned to 
handle this job himself, not only to help a new, inexperienced 
man 'make bis bones’, but to settle a personal score with 
Paulie Gatto. Paulie had been his prot^g^, he had advanced 
Paulie over the heads of more deserving and more loyal people, 
he had helped Paulie 'make his bones’ and furthered his career 
in every way. Paulie had not only betrayed the Family, he had 
betrayed his padrone^ Peter Gemenza. This lack of respect had 
to be repaid. 

Everything else was arranged. Paulie Gatto had been in- 
structed to pick him up at three in the afternoon, and to pick 
him up with his own car, nothing hot. Now Gemenza took up 
the telephone and dialled Rocco Lampone’s number. He did 
not identify himself. He simply said, ‘Come to my house, 
I have an errand for you.’ He was pleased to note that 
despite the early hour, Lampone’s voice was not surprised 
or dazed with sleep and he simply said, *OK.’ Good man. 
Gemenza added, ‘No rush, have your breakfast and lunch 
first before you come see me. But not later than two in the 
afternoon,’ 

There was another laconic OK on the other end and 
Gemenza hung up the phone. He had already alerted his 
people about replacing caporegimi Tessio’s people in the Cor- 
leone mall so that was done. He had capable subordinates and 
never interfered in a mechanical operation of that kind. 

He decided to wash his Cadillac. He loved the car. It gave 
him such a quiet peaceful ride, and its upholstery was so rich 
that he sometimes sat in it for an hour when the weather was 
good bexause it was more pleasant than sitting in the house. 
And it always helped him think when he was grooming the 
car. He remembered his father in Italy doing the same thing 
with donkeys. 

Gemenza worked inside the heated garage, he hated cold. 
He ran over his plans. You had to be careful with Paulie, the 
man was like a rat, he could smeU danger. And now of course 
despite being so tough he must be shitting in his pants because 
die old man was still alive. He’d be as skittish as a donkey with 


104 



ants up his ass. But Qemen^a was accustomed to these cir- 
cumstances, usual in his work. First, he had to have a good 
excuse for Rocco to accompany them. Second, he had to have 
a plausible mission for the three of them to go on. 

Of course, strictly speaking, this was not necessary. Paulie 
Gatto could be killed without any of these frills. He was locked 
in, he could not run away. But Clemenaa felt strongly that it 
was important to keep good working habits and never give 
away a fraction of a percentage point. You never could tell 
what might happen and these matters were, after all, questions 
of life and death. 

As he washed his baby-blue Cadillac, Peter Qemen^a pon- 
dered and rehearsed his lines, the expressions of his face. He 
would be curt with Paulie, as if displeased with him. With a 
man so sensitive and suspicious as Gatto this would throw 
him oft' the track or at least leave him uncertain. Undue 
friendliness would make him wary. But of course the curtness 
must not be too angry. It had to be rather an absentminded 
sort of irritation. And why Lampone? Paulie would find that 
most alarming, especially since lampone had to be in the rear 
seat. Paulie wouldn’t like being hdpless at the wheel with 
Lampone behind his head. Clemenza rubbed and polished the 
metal of his Cadillac furiously. It was going to be tricky. Very 
tricky. For a moment he debated whether to recruit another 
man but decided against it. Here he followed basic reasoning. 
In years to come a situation might arise where it might be 
profitable for one of his partners to testify against him. If there 
were just one accomplice it was one’s word against the other. 
But the word of a second accomplice could swing the balance. 
No, they would stick to procedure. • 

What annoyed Qemenza was that the execution had to be 
•public’. That is, the body was to be found. He would have 
much preferred having it disappear. (Usual burying grounds 
were the nearby ocean or the swamplands of New Jersey on 
land owned by fidends of the Family or by other more complic- 
ated methods.) But it had to be public so that embryo traitors 
would be frightened and the enemy warned that the Corleone 
Family had by no means gone stupid of soft, ^ollozzo would 
be made wary by this quick discovery of his spy. The Corleone 


105 



Family would win back some of its prestige. It had been made 
to look foolish by the shooting of the old man, 

Clemenza sighed. The Cadillac gleamed like a huge blue 
steel egg, and he was nowhere near the solving of his prob- 
lem. Then the solution hit him, logical and to the point. It 
would explain Rocco Lampone, himself, and Paulie being 
together and give them a mission of sufficient secrecy and 
importance. 

He would tell Paulie that their job today was to find an 
apartment in case the Family decided to ‘ go to the mattresses ’. 

Whenever a war between the Families became bitterly in- 
tense, the opponents would set up headquarters in secret 
apartments where the ‘soldiers’ could sleep on mattresses 
scattered through the rooms. This was not so much to keep 
their families out of danger, their wives and little children, 
since any attack on noncombatants was undreamed of. All 
parties were too vulnerable to similar retaliation. But it was 
always smarter to live in some secret place where your every- 
day movements could not be charted either by your opponents 
or by some police who might arbitrarily decide to meddle. 

And so usually a trusted caporegime would be sent out to 
rent a secret apartment and fill it with mattresses. That apart- 
ment would be used as a sally port into the city when an 
offensive was mounted. It was ni&tural for Clemenza to be sent 
on such an errand. It was natural for him to take Gatto and 
Lampone with him to arrange all the details, ixicluding the 
furnishing of the apartment. Also, Clemenza thought with a 
grin, Paulie Gatto had proved he was greedy and the first 
thought that would pop into his head was how much he could 
get from Sollozzo for this valuable intelligence. 

Roedb Lampone arrived earl]' and Clemenza explained what 
had to be done and what their roles would be, Lampone’s face 
lit up with surprised gratitude and he thanked Gemenza 
respectfully for the promotion allowing him to serve the 
Family. Gemenza was sure he had done well. He clapped 
Lampone on the shoulder and said, ‘You’ll get something 
better for your living after today. We’ll talk about that later. 
You understand the Family now is occupied with more critical 
matters, more important things to do.’ Lampone made a 

106 



gesture that said he would be patient, knowing his reward was 
certain. 

Clemenza went to his den’s safe and opened it. He took out 
a gun and gave it to Lampone. ‘Use this one,’ he said. ‘They 
can never trace it. Leave it in the car with Paulie. When this 
job is finished I want you to take your wife and children on a 
vacation to Florida. Use your own money now and I’ll pay you 
back later. Relax, get the sun. Use the Family hotel in Miami 
Beach so Fll know where I can get you when I want.’ 

Clemenza’s wife knocked on the door of the den to tell them 
that Paulie Gatto had arrived. He was parked in the driveway. 
Clemenza led the way through the garage and Lampone fol- 
lowed him. When Clemenza got into the front seat with Gatto 
he merely grunted in greeting, an exasperated look on his face. 
He looked at the wrist watch as if he expected to find that 
Gatto was late. 

The ferret-faced button man was watching him intently, 
looking for a clue. He flinched a little 'when Lampone got into 
the rear seat behind him and said, ‘ Rocco, sit on the other side. 
A big guy like you blocks up my rear- view mirror.’ Lampone 
shifted dutifully so that he was sitting behind Clemenza, as if 
such a request was the most natural thing in the world. 

Clemenza said sourly to Gatto, ‘Damn that Sonny, he's 
running scared. He’s already thinking of going to the mat- 
tresses. We have to find a place on the West Side. Paulie, you 
and Rocco gotta staff and supply it until the word comes 
down for the rest of the soldiers to use it. You know a good 
location?’ 

As he had expected, Gatto’s eyes became greedily interested. 
Paulie had swallowed the bait and because he w^^s thinking 
how much the information was worth to Sollozzo, he was for- 
getting to think about whether he was in danger. Also, Lam- 
pone was acting his part perfectly, staring out the window in a 
disinterested, relaxed way. Clemenza congratulated himself on 
his choice. 

Gatto shrugged. T’d have to think about it,’ he said. 

Clemenza grunted. ‘Drive while you think, I want to get to 
New York today.’ 

Paulie was an expert driver and traffic going into the dty 

107 



was light at this time in the afternoon, so the early winter 
darkness was just beginning to fall when they arriTed. There 
was no small talk in the car. Qemenza directed Paulie to drive 
up to the Washington Heights section. He checked a few 
apartment buildings and told him to park near Arthur Avenue 
and wait. He also left Rocco Lampone in the car. He went into 
the Vera Mario Restaurant and had a light dinner of veal and 
salad, nodding his helloes to some acquaintances. After an 
hour had gone by he walked the several blocks to where the 
car was parked and entered it. Gatto and Lampone were still 
waiting. ‘Shit,’ Clemen2a said, ‘they want us back in Long 
Beach. They got some other job for us now. Sonny says we 
can let this one go until later. Rocco, you live in the city, can 
we drop you off? * 

Rocco said quietly, ‘I have my car out at your place and my 
old lady needs it first thing in the morning.’ 

‘That’s right,’ Clemenza said. ‘Then you have to come back 
with us, after all.’ 

Again on the ride back to Long Beach nothing was said. On 
the stretch of road that led into the city, Clemenza said sud- 
denly, ‘Paulie, pull over, I gotta take a leak.’ From working 
together so long, Gatto knew the fat caporegime had a weak 
bladder. He had often made such a request. Gatto pulled the 
car off the highway into the soft earth that led to the swamp. 
Clemenza climbed out of the car and took a few steps into the 
bushes. He actually relieved himself. Then as he opened the 
door to get back into the car he took a quick look up and 
down the highway, 'fhere were no lights, the road was com- 
pletely dark. ‘Go ahead,’ Clemenza said. A second later the 
interior of the car reverberated with the report of a gim. 
Paulie Gatto seemed to jump forward, his body flinging 
against the steering wheel and then slumping over to the seat. 
Clemenza had stepped back hastily to avoid being hit with 
fragments of skull bone and blood. 

Rocco Lampone scrambled out of the back seat. He still 
held the gun and he threw it into the swamp. He and Oemenza 
walked hastily to a car parked nearby and got in. Lampone 
reached underneath the seat and found the key that had been 
left for them. He started the car and drove Qemenza to his 

108 



home. Then instead of going back by the same toute» he took 
the Jones Beach Causeway right on through to the town of 
Merrick and onto the Meadowbrook Parkway until he reached 
the Northern State Parkway. He rode that to the Long Island 
Expressway and then continued on to the Whitestone Bridge 
and through the Bronx to his home in Manhattan. 


CHAPTER SEVEN 


On the night before the shooting of Don Corlcone, his 
strongest and most loyal and most feared retainer prepared to 
meet with the enemy. Luca Brasi had made contact with the 
forces of Sollozzo several months before. He had done so on 
the orders of Don Corlcone himself. He had done so by 
frequenting the nightclubs controlled by the Tattaglia Family 
and by taking up with one of their top call girls. In bed with 
this call girl he grumbled about how he was held down in the 
Corleone Family, how his worth was not recognized. After a 
week of this affair with the call girl, Luca was approached by 
Bruno Tattaglia, manager of the nightclub. Bruno was the 
youngest son, and ostensibly not connected with the Family 
business of prostitution. But his famous nightclub with its 
dancing Line of long-stemmed beauties was the finishing school 
for many of the city hookers. 

The ^st meeting was all above-board, Tattaglia offering 
him a job to work in the Family business as enforcer. The 
flirtation went on for nearly a month. Luca played ^his role of 
man infatuated with a young beautiful girl, Bruno Tattaglia 
the role of a businessman trying to recruit an able executive 
from a rival. At one such meeting, Luca pretended to be 
swayed, then said, ‘ But one thing must be understood. 1 will 
never go against the Godfather. Don Corleone is a man 1 re- 
spect. 1 understand that he must put his sons before me in the 
Family business.* 

Bruno Tattaglia was one of the new generation with a barely 
hidden contempt for the old Moustache Petes like Luca Brasi, 


109 



Don Corlcone, and even his own father. He was just a little too 
i-espectful. Now he said, ‘My father wouldn’t expect you to do 
anything against the Corleones. Why should he? Everybody 
gets along with everybody else now, it’s not like the old days. 
It’s just that if you’re looking for a new job, I can pass along 
the word to my father. There’s always need for a man like you 
in our business. It’s a hard business and it needs hard men to 
keep it running smooth. Let me know if you ever make up 
your mind.* 

Luca shrugged. ‘It’s not so bad where I’m at.’ And so they 
ieft it. 

The general idea had been to lead the Tattaglias to believe 
chat he knew about the lucrative narcotics operation and that he 
wanted a piece of it freelance. In that fashion he might hear 
something about Sollozzo’s plans if the Turk had any, or 
whether he was getting ready to step on the toes of Don 
Corlcone. After waiting for two months with nothing else 
happening, Luca reported to the Don that obviously Sol- 
\ozzo was taking his defeat graciously. The Don had told him 
to keep trying but merely as a sideline, not to press it, 

Luca had dropped into the nightclub the evening before 
Don Cotlconc’s being shot. Almost immediately Bruno 
Tattaglia had come to his table and sat down. 

‘ I have a friend who wants to talk to you,’ he said. 

‘ Bring him over,’ Luca said. T’ll talk to any friend of yours.’ 

‘No,’ Bruno said. ‘He wants to see you in private.’ 

‘Who is he?’ Luca asked. 

‘Just a friend of mine,’ Bruno Tattaglia said. ‘He wants to 
put a proposition to you. Can you meet him later on tonight?’ 

‘Sure,’ Luca said. ‘What time and where?’ 

Tattdglia said softly, ‘ The club closes at four in the morning. 
^X'hy don’t you meet in here while the waiters are cleaning 
up?’ 

They knew his habits, Luca thought, they must have been 
checking him out. He usually got up about three or four in the 
afternoon and had breakfast, then amused himself by. gambling 
with cronies in the Family or had a girl. Sometimes he saw one 
of the midnight movies and then would drop in for a drink at 
one of the clubs. He never went to bed before dawn. So the 


no 



suggestion of a four a m meeting was not as outlandish as it 
seemed. 

‘Sure, sure/ he said. ‘Til be back at four.* He left the club 
and caught a cab to his furnished ror)m on Tenth Avenue. He 
boarded with an Italian family to which he was distantly 
related. His two rooms were separated from the rest of their 
railroad flat by a special door. He liked the arrangement 
because it gave him some family life and also protection 
against surprise where he was most vulnerable. 

The sly Turkish fox was going to show his bushy tail, Luca 
thought. If things went far enough, if Sollozzo committed 
himself tonight, maybe the whole thing could be wound up as 
a Christmas present for the Don. In his room, Luca unlocked 
the trunk beneath the bed and took out a bulletproof vest. It 
was heavy. He undressed and put it on over his woollen under- 
wear, then put his shirt and jacket over it. He thought for a 
moment of calling the Don’s house at Long Beach to tell him 
of this new development but he knew the Don never talked 
over the phone, to anyone, and the Don had given him thiy 
assignment in secret and so did not want anyone, not even 
Hagen or his eldest son, to know about it. 

Luca always carried a gun. He had a licence to carry a gun, 
probably the most expensive gun licence ever issued any place, 
any time. It had cost a total of ten thousand dollars but it 
would keep him out of jail if he was frisked by the cops. As a 
top executive operating ofhcial of the Family he rated the 
licence. But tonight, just in case he could finish off the job, he 
wanted a ‘safe’ gun. One that could not possibly be traced. 
But then thinking the matter over, he decided that he would 
just listen to the proposition tonight and report back to the 
Godfather, Don Corleone. 

He made his way back to the club but he did not drink any 
more. Instead he wandered out to 48th Street, where he had a 
leisurely late supper at Patsy’s, his favourite Italian restaurant. 
When it was time for his appointment he drifted uptown to the 
club entrance. The doorman was no longer there when he 
went in. The hat-check girl was gone. Only Bruno Tattaglia 
waited to greet him and lead him to the deserted bar at the side 
of the room. Before him he could see the desert of small tables 


111 



with the polished yellow wood dance floor gleaming like a 
small diamond in the middle of them. In the shadows was the 
empty bandstand, out of it grew the skeleton metal stalk of a 
microphone. 

Luca sat at the bar and Bruno Tattaglia went behind it. 
Luca refused the drink offered to him and lit a cigarette. It was 
possible that this would turn out to be something else, not the 
Turk. But then he saw Sollozzo emerge out of the shadows at 
the far end of the room. 

Solloz2o shook his hand and sat at the bar next to him. 
Tattaglia put a glass in front of the Turk, who nodded his 
thanks. *Do you know who lam?’ asked Sollozxo. 

Luca nodded. He smiled grimly. The rats were being flushed 
out of their holes. It would be his pleasure to take care of this 
renegade Sicilian. 

‘Do you know what I am going to ask of you?’ SoUozzo 
asked. 

Luca shook his head. 

‘There’s big business to be made/ S0II0220 said. ‘I mean 
millions for everybody at the top level. On the first shipment I 
can guarantee you fi^ thousand dollars. I’m talking about 
drugs. It’s the coming thing.’ 

Luca said, ‘Why come to me? You want me to talk to my 
Don?’ 

Solloczo grimaced. ‘Fvc already talked to the Don. He 
wants no part of it. All right, 1 can do without him. But I need 
somebody strong to protect the operation physically. I 
understand you’re not happy 'with your Family, you might 
make a switch.’ 

Luca shrugged. ‘If the o^ is good enough.’ 

S0II0Z20 had been watching him intently and seemed to 
have come to a decision. ‘Think about my offer for a few days 
and then we’ll talk again,’ he said. He put out his hand but 
Luca pretended not to see it and busied himself putting a 
cigarette in his mouth. Behind the bar, Bruno Tattaglia made a 
lighter appear magically and held it to Luca’s cigarette. And 
then he ^d a strange thing. He dropped the lighter on the bar 
and grabbed Luca’s right hand, holding it tight. 

Luca reacted instantly, his body slipping off the bar stool 


iix 



and trying to twist away. But Solloaso had grabbed his other 
hand at the wrist. Still, Luca was too strong for both of them 
and would have broken free except that a man stepped out of 
the shadows behind him and threw a thin silken cord around 
his neck. The cord pulled tight, choking off Lucans breath. His 
face became purple, the strength in his arms drained away. 
Tattaglia and Sollozzo held his hands easily now, and they 
stood there curiously childlike as the man behind Luca pulled 
the cord around Luca’s neck tighter and tighter. Suddenly the 
floor was wet and slippery. Luca’s sphincter, no longer under 
control, opened, the waste of his body spilled out. There was 
no strength in him any more and his legs folded, his body 
sagged. Solloz2o and Tattaglia let his hands go and only the 
strangler stayed with the victim, sinking to his knees to follow 
Luca’s falling body, drawing the cord so tight that it cut 
into the flesh of the neck and disappeared. Luca’s eyes were 
bulging out of his head as if in the utmost surprise and this 
surprise was the only humanity remaining to him. He was 
dead. 

don’t want him found,’ Sollozzo said. ‘It’s important that 
he not be found right now.’ He turned on his heel and left, 
disappearing back into the shadows. 


CHAPTER EIGHT 

The DAT after the shooting of Don Corleone was a busy time 
for the Family. Michael stayed by the phone relaying messages 
to Sonny. Tom Hagen was busy trying to And a mediator satis- 
factory to both parties so that a conference could be arranged 
with Sollozzo. The Turk had suddenly become cagey, perhaps 
he knew that the Family button men of Qemenza and Tessio 
were ranging far and wide over the city in an attempt to pick 
up his trail. But Sollozzo was sticking close to his hideout, as 
were all top members of the TattagOa Family. This was ex- 
pected by Sonny, an elementary precaution he knew the 
enemy was bound to take. 



Clemen2a was tied up with Paulie Gatto. Tessio had been 
given the assignment of trying to track down the whereabouts 
of Luca Brasi. Luca had not been home since the night before 
the shooting, a bad sign. But Sonny could not believe that 
Brasi had either turned traitor or had been taken by surprise. 

Mama Corleonc was staying in the city with friends of the 
Family so that she could be near the hospital. Carlo Rizzi, the 
son-in-law, had offered his services but had been told to take 
care of his own business that Don Corleone had set him up in, 
a lucrative bookmaking territory in the Italian section of Man- 
hattan. Connie was staying with her mother in town so that 
she too could visit her father in the hospital. 

Freddie was still under sedation in his own room of his 
parents’ house. Sonny and Michael had paid him a visit and 
had been astonished at his paleness, his obvious illness. 
‘ Christ,* Sonny said to Michael when they left Freddie’s room, 
*hc looks like he got plugged worse than the old man.* 

Michael shrugged. He had seen soldiers in the same condi- 
tion on the battlefield. But he had never expected it to happen 
to Freddie. He remembered the middle brother as being 
physically the toughest one in the family when all of them were 
kids. But he had also been the most obedient son to his father. 
And yet everyone knew that the Don had given up on this 
middle son ever being important to the business. He wasn’t 
quite smart enough; and failing that, not quite ruthless 
enough. He was too retiring a person, did not have enough 
force. 

Late in the afternoon, Michael got a call from Johnny Fon- 
tanc in Hollywood. Sonny took the phone. ‘Nah, Johnny, no 
use coming back here to see the old man. He’s too sick and it 
would give you a lot of bad publicity, and I know the old man 
wouldri’t like that. Wait until he’s better and vre can move him 
home, then come see him. OK, I’ll give him your regards.’ 
Sonny hung up the phone. He turned to Michael and said, 
‘That’ll make Pop happy, that Johnny wanted to fly from 
California to see how he was.’ 

Late that afternoon, Michael was called to the listed phone 
in the kitchen by one of Clemenza’s men. It was Kay. 

‘Is your father all right?’ she asked. Her voice was a little 



strained, a little unnatural. Michael knew that she couldn’t 
quite believe what had happened, that his father really was 
what the newspapers called a gangster, 

‘He’ll be OK,’ Michael said. 

‘Can I come with you when you visit him in the hospital?’ 
Kay asked. 

Michael laughed. She had remembered him telling her how 
important it was to do such things if you wanted to get along 
with the old Italians. ‘This is a special case,’ he said. ‘If the 
newspaper guys get a hold of your name and background 
you’U be on page three of the Daily Neufj. Girl from old 
Yankee family mixed up with son of big Mafia chief. How 
would your parents like that?’ 

Kay said dryly, ‘My parents never read the Daily Neu/j.' 
Again there was an awkward pause and then she said, ‘You’re 
OK, aren’t you, Mike, you’re not in any danger?* 

Mike laughed again. ‘I’m known as the sissy of the Corleone 
famOy. No threat. So they don’t have to bother coming after 
me. No, it’s all over, Kay, there won’t be any more trouble. 
It was all sort of an accident anyway. I’ll explain when I see 
you.’ 

‘When will that be?’ she asked. 

Michael pondered. ‘How about late tonight? We’ll have a 
drink and supper in your hotel and then I’ll go to the hospital 
and see my old man. I’m getting tired of hanging around here 
answering phones. OK? But don’t tell anybody. I don’t want 
newspaper photographers snapping pictures of us together. 
No Iddding, Kay, it’s damned embarrassing, especially for 
your parents.’ 

‘AU right,’ Kay said. ‘I’ll be waiting. Can I do any Christmas 
shopping for you ? Or anything else ? ’ 

‘No,’ Michael said. ‘Just be ready.’ 

She gave a little excited laugh. ‘I’ll be ready,’ she said. 
‘Aren’t I always?’ 

‘Yes, you are,’ he said. ‘That’s why you’re my best girl.’ 

‘I love you,’ she said. ‘Can you say it?’ 

Michael looked at the four hoods sitting in the kitchen. 
‘No,’ he said. ‘Tonight, OK?’ 

‘OK,’ she said. He hung up. 


”5 



Qcmcnza had finally come back from his day^s work and 
was bustling around the kitchen cooking up a huge pot of 
tomato sauce. Michael nodded to him and went to the corner 
office where he found Hagen and Sonny waiting for him im- 
patiently. ‘Is Clemenza out there?’ Sonny asked. 

Michael grinned. ‘He*s cooking up spaghetti for the troops, 
iust like the army.’ 

Sonny said impatiently, ‘Tell him to cut out that crap and 
come on in here. I have more important things for him to do. 
Get Tessio in here with him.’ 

In a few minutes they were all gathered tn the office. Sonny 
said curtly to Clemenza, ‘You take care of him?’ 

Qemenza nodded. ‘You won’t see him any more.’ 

With a slight electric shock, Michael realized they were 
talking about Paulie Gatto and that little Paulie was dead, 
murdered by that jolly wedding dancer, Clemenza. 

Sonny asked Hagen, ‘You have any luck with Sollozzo?’ 

Hagen shook his head. ‘He seems to have cooled off on the 
negotiation idea. Anyway he doesn’t seem to be too anxious. 
Or maybe he’s just being very careful so that our button men 
won’t nail him. Anyway I haven’t been able to set up a top- 
notch go-between he’ll trust. But he must know he has to 
negotiate now. He missed his chance when he let the old man 
get away from him.’ 

Sonny said, ‘He’s a smart guy, the smartest our Family ever 
came up against. Maybe he figured we’re just stalling until the 
old man gets better or we can get a line on him.’ 

Hagen shrugged. ‘ Sure, be figures that. But he still has to 
negotiate. He has no choice. I’ll get it set up tomorrow. That’s 
certain.’ 

One of Clemenza’s men knocked on the office door and 
then came in. He said to Clemenza, ‘It just came over the 
radio, the cops found Paulie Gatto. Dead in his car.’ 

Qemenza nodded and said to the man, ‘ Don’t worry about 
it.’ The button man gave his capore^mi an astonished look, 
which was followed by a look of comprehension, before he 
went back to the kitchen. 

The conference went on as if there had been no interruption. 
Sonny asked Hagca, ‘Any change in the Don’s condition?’ 

1x6 



Hftgeo shook his head. *He*s OK but he won’t be able to 
talk fbf another couple of days. He’s all knocked out. Still re- 
covering from the operation. Your mother spends most of the 
day with him, Connie too. There’s cops all over the hospital 
and Tessio’s men hang aroimd too, just in case. In a couple of 
days he’ll be all right and then we can see what he wants us to 
do. Meanwhile we have to keep Sollozao from doing anything 
rash. That’s why I want to start you talking deals with him.’ 

Soimy grunted. ‘Until he does, I’ve got Oemenza and 
Tessio "looking for him. Maybe we’ll get lucky and solve the 
whole business.’ 

‘You won’t get lucky,* Hagen said. ‘ ScUoaso is too smart* 
Hagen paused. ‘He knows once he comes to fbe tabic ]>e*& 
have to go our way mpsdy. That’s why lu^s stalling. Fm 
guessing he’s trying to line up support from the other New 
York Families so ^at we won’t go' after him when the oU 
man gives us the word.’ 

Sonny frowned. ‘ Why the hell should they do that? * 

Hagen said patiently, ‘To avert a big war which hurts every- 
body and brings the papers and government into the act. Also, 
Sollozzo will give them a piece of the action. And you know 
how much dough there is in drugs. The Corleone Family 
doesn’t need it, we have the gambling, which is the best 
business to have. But the other Families are hungry. SoUozzo 
is a proven man, they know he can make the operation go on a 
big scale. Alive he’s money in their pockets, dead he’s 
trouble.’ 

Sonny’s face was as Michael had never seen it. The heavy 
Cupid mouth and bronzed skin seemed grey. ‘I don’t give a 
fude what they want. They better not mess in this fight.’ 

Qemenza and Tessio shifted uneasily in their chairs, infantry 
leaders who hear their general rave about storming an im- 
pregnable hill no matter what the cost. Hagen said a little 
impatiently, ‘Come on. Sonny, your father wouldn’t like you 
thinking that way. You know what he always says, “That’s a 
waste. ” Sure, we’re not going to let anybody stop us if the old 
man says we go after Sollozzo. But this is oot a personal thing, 
this is business. If we go after the Turk and the Families inter- 
fere, we’ll negotiate the issue. If the Families see that we’re 



detemuned to have SoUozzo, they’ll let us. The Don will make 
concessions in other areas to square things. But don’t go blood 
crazy on a thing like this. It’s business. Even the shooting of 
your father was business, not personal. You should know that 
by now.’ 

Sonny’s eyes were still hard. ‘OK, I understand all that. Just 
so long as you understand that nobody stands in our way 
when we want SoUozzo.’ 

Sonny turned to Tessio. ‘Any leads on Luca?* 

Tessio shook his head. ‘None at all. SoUozzo must have 
snatched him.’ 

Hagen said quietly, ‘SoUozzo wasn’t worried about Luca, 
which struck me as funny. He’s too smart not to worry about a 
guy like Luca. I think he maybe got him out of the picture, 
one way or the other.’ 

Sonny muttered, ‘Christ, I hope Luca isn’t fighting against 
us. That’s the one thing I’d be afraid of. Clemenza, Tessio, 
how do you two guys figure it?* 

Qemenza said slowly, ‘Anybody could go wrong, look at 
Paulie. But with Luca, he was a man who could only go one 
way. The Godfather was the only thing he believed in, the 
only man he feared. But not only that. Sonny, he respected 
your father as no one else respected him and the Godfather has 
earned respect from everyone. No, Luca would never betray 
us. And I find it hard to believe that a man Uke SoUozzo, no 
matter how cunning, could surprise Luca. He was a man who 
suspected everyone and evcr3rthing. He was always ready for 
the worst. I think maybe he just went off some place for a few 
days. We’ll be hearing from him any time now.’ 

Sonny turned to Tessio. The Brooklyn caporegime shrugged. 
‘Any man can turn traitor. Luca was very touchy. Maybe the 
Don offended him some way. That could be. I think though 
that SoUozzo gave him a little surprise. That fits in with what 
the ConsigHori says. We should expect the worst.’ 

Sonny said to aU of them, ‘SoUozzo should get the word 
soon about Paulie Gatto. How will that affect him?’ 

Qemenza said grimly, ‘It wiU make him think. He wiU 
know the Corlcone Family arc not fools. He wiU realize that he 
was very lucky yesterday.’ 

ii8 



Sonny said sharply, ‘That wasn’t luck. Sollozzo was plan- 
ning that for weeks. They must have tailed the old man to his 
ofHce every day and watched his routine. Then they bought 
Paulic off and maybe Luca. They snatched Tom right on the 
button. They did everything they wanted to do. They were 
unlucky, not lucky. Those button men they hired weren’t good 
enough and the old man moved too quick. If they had killed 
him, I would have had to make a deal and Sollozzo would 
have won. For now. I would have waited maybe and got him 
five, ten years from now. But don’t call him lucky, Pete, that’s 
underrating him. And we’ve done that too much lately.’ ' 

One of the button men brought a bowl of spaghetti in from 
the kitchen and then some plates, forks and wine. They ate as 
they talked. Michael watched in amazement. He didn’t eat and 
neither did Tom, but Sonny, Clemcnza and Tessio dug in, 
mopping up sauce with crusts of bread. It was almost comical. 
They continued their discussion. 

Tessio didn’t think that the loss of Paulie Gatto would upset 
Sollozzo, in fact he thought that the Turk might have antici- 
pated it, indeed might have welcomed it. A useless mouth off 
the payroll. And he would not be frightened by it ; after all, 
would they be in such a situation? 

Michael spoke up diffidently. ‘I know I’m an amateur in 
this, but from everything you guys have said about Sollozzo, 
plus the fact that all of a sudden he’s out of touch with Tom, 
I’d guess he has an ace up his sleeve. He might be ready to puU 
off something real tricky that would put him back on top. If 
we could figure out what that would be, we’d be in the driver’s 
seat.’ 

Sonny said reluctantly, ‘Yeah, I thought of that and the only 
thing 1 can figure is Luca. The word is already out that he’s to 
be brought here before he’s allowed any of his old rights in the 
Family. The only other thing I can think of is that Sollozzo has 
made his deal with the Families in New York and we’ll get the 
word tomorrow that they will be against us in a war. That 
we’ll have to give the Turk his deal. Right, Tom?’ 

Hagen nodded. ‘That’s what it looks like to me. And we 
can’t move against that kind of opposition without your 
father. He’s the only one who can stand against the Families. 


1x9 



He has the political connexions they always need and he can 
use them for trading. If he wants to badly enough.* 

Qemenxa said a little arrogantly for a man whose top button 
man had recently betrayed him» *Sollozzo will never get near 
this house. Boss, you don’t have to worry about that.* 

Soimy looked at him thoughtfully for a moment. Then he 
said to Tessio, *How about the hospital, your men got it 
covered?* 

For the first time during the conference Tessio seemed to be 
absolutely sure of his ground. * Outside and inside,’ he said. 
^ Right around the clock. The cops have it covered pretty good 
too. Detectives ^t the bedroom doot waiting to question the 
old man. That’s a laugh. The Don is still getting that stuff in 
the tubes, no food, so we don’t have to worry about the 
kitchen, which would be something to worry about with those 
Turks, they believe in poison. They can’t get at the Don, not 
in any way.’ 

Sonny tilted back in his chair. *It wouldn’t be me, they have 
to do business with me, they need the Family machine.’ He 
grinned at Michael. wonder if it’s you? Maybe SoUozzo 
figures to snatch you and hold you for a hostage to make a 
deal.’ 

Michael thought ruefully, there goes my date with Kay. 
Sonny wouldn’t let him out of the house. But Hagen said im- 
patiently, ‘No, he could have snatched Mike any time if he 
wanted insurance. But everybody knows that Mike is not in 
the Family business. He’s a civilian and if Sollozzo snatches 
him, then he loses all the other New York Families. Even 
the Tattaglias would have to help hunt him down. No, it’s 
simple enough. Tomorrow we’ll get a representative from 
all the F^amilies who’ll tell us we have to do business with the 
Turk. That’s what he’s waiting for. That’s his ace in the 
hole.’ 

Michael heaved a sigh of relief. ‘Good,’ he said. ‘I have to 
go into town tonight.’ 

‘Why?’ Sormy asked sharply. 

Michael grinned. ‘I figure I’ll drop in to the hospital and 
visit the old man, see Mom and Connie. And 1 got some other 
things to do.’ like the Don, Michael n^er told his real 


lao 



business and now he didn’t want to tell Sonny he was teeing 
Kay Adams. There was no reason not to tell him, it was just 
habit. 

There was a loud murmur of voices in the kitchen. Ckmenza 
went out to sec what was happening. When he came back he 
was holding Luca Brasi’s bulletproof vest in his hands. 
Wrapped in the vest was a huge dead fish. 

Qemenza said dryly, *Thc Turk has heard about his spy 
Paulic Gatto.’ 

Tessio said just as dryly, ‘And now we know about Luca 
Brasi.’ 

Sonny lit a dgai and took a shot of whisky. Michael, be- 
wildered, said, ‘What the hell does that fish mean?’ It was 
Hagen the Irisher, the Consigiioriy who answered him. ‘The 
fish means that Luca Brasi is sleeping on the bottom of the 
ocean,’ he said. ‘It’s an old Sicilian message.’ 


CHAPTER NINE 

When Michael Corleone went into the city that night it was 
with a depressed spirit. He felt that he was being enmeshed in 
the Family business against his will and he resented Sonny 
using him even to answer the phone. He felt uncomfortable 
being on the inside of the Family councils as if he could be 
absolutely trusted with such secrets as murder. And now, 
going to see Kay, he felt guilty about her also. He had never 
been completely honest with her about his family. He had told 
her about them but always with little jokes and colourful anec- 
dotes that made them seem more like adventurers in a Techni- 
colour movie than what they really were. And now his fi&ther 
had been shot down in the street and his eldest brother was 
making plans for murder. That was putting it plainly and 
simply but that was never how he would tell it to Kzy, He had 
alrouly said his father being shot was more like an ^accident’ 
and that all the trouble was over. Hell, it looked like it was just 
beginning. Sonny and Tom were off-centre on this guy SoUoazo, 


121 



they were still underrating him, even though Sonny was 
smart enough to see the danger. Michael tried to think what 
the Turk might have up his sleeve. He was obviously a bold 
man, a clever man, a man of extraprdinary force. You had to 
figure him to come up with a real surprise. But then Sonny and 
Tom and Clemen 2 a and Tessio were all agreed that everything 
was under control and they all had more experience than he 
did. He was the ‘civilian' in this war, Michael thought wryly. 
And they'd have to give him a hell of a lot better medals than 
he’d got in World War 11 to make him join this one. 

Thinking this made him feel guilty about not feeling more 
sympathy for his father. His own father shot full of holes and 
yet in a curious way Michael, better than anyone else, under- 
stood when Tom had said it was just busiiless, not personal. 
That his father had paid for the power he had wielded all 
his life, the respect he had extorted from all those around 
him. 

What Michael wanted was out, out of all this, to lead his 
own life. But he couldn’t cut loose from the family until the crisis 
was over. He had to help in a civilian capacity. With sudden 
clarity he realized that he was annoyed with the role assigned 
to him, that of the privileged noncombatant, the excused con- 
scientious objector. That was why the word ‘civilian’ kept 
popping into his skull in such an irritating way. 

\^en he got to the hotel, Kay was waiting for him in the 
lobby. (A couple of Qemenza’s people had driven him into 
town and dropped him ofi on a nearby corner after making 
sure they were not followed.) 

They had dinner together and some drinks. ‘What time arc 
you going to visit your father?’ Kay asked. 

Michael looked at his watch. ‘Visiting hours end at eight- 
thirty. I think I'll go after everybody has left. They'll let me 
up. He has a private room and his own nurses so 1 can just sit 
with him for a while. I don’t think he can talk yet or even 
know if I’m there. But I have to show respect.’ 

Kay said quietly, ‘I feel so sorry for your father, he seemed 
like such a nice man at the wedding. I can’t believe the things 
the papers are printing about him. I’m sure most of it’s not 
true.’ 


122 



Michad said politely, don’t think so either.* He was sur- 
prised to find himself so secretive with Kay. He loved her, he 
trusted her, but he would never tell her anything about his 
father or the Family. She was an outsider. 

‘What about you?’ Kay asked. ‘Arc you going to get mixed 
up in this gang war the papers are talking about so gleefully?* 

Michael grinned, unbuttoned his jacket and held it wide 
open. ‘Look, no guns,’ he said. Kay laughed. 

It was getting late and they went up to their room. She 
mixed a drink for both of them and sat on his lap as they drank. 
Beneath her dress she was all silk until his hand touched the 
glowing skin of her thigh. They fell back on the bed together 
and made love with all their clothes on, their mouths glued 
together. When they were finished they lay very still, feeling 
the heat of their bodies burning through their garments. Kay 
murmured, ‘Is that what you soldiers call a quickie?’ 

‘Yeah,’ Michael said. 

‘It’s not bad,’ Kay said in a judicious voice. 

They do2ed off until Michael suddenly started up anxiously 
and looked at his watch. ‘Damn,’ he said. ‘It’s nearly ten. I 
have to get down to the hospital.’ He went to the bathroom to 
wash up and comb his hair. Kay came in after him and put her 
arms around his waist from behind. ‘When are we going to get 
married ? ’ she asked. 

‘Whenever you say,’ Michael said. ‘As soon as this family 
thing quiets down and my old man gets better. I think you’d 
better explain things to your parents though.’ 

‘What should I explain?’ Kay said quietly. 

Michael ran the comb through his hair. ‘Just say that you’ve 
met a brave, handsome guy of Italian descent. Top marks at 
Dartmouth. Distinguished Service Cross during the war plus 
the Purple Heart. Honest. Hard-working. But his father is a 
Mafia chief who has to kill bad people, sometimes bribe high 
government officials and in his line of work gets shot full of 
holes himself. But that has nothing to do with Iiis honest hard- 
working son. Do you think you can remember all that?’ 

Kay let go his body and leaned against the door of the 
bathroom. ‘Is he really?’ she said. ‘Does he really?’ She 
paused. ‘Kill people?’ 



Midbad fin&hed oombiag hb btit. *I doa*t really know/ he 
^id. ‘Nobcxly really knows. But 1 wouldo*i be surprised.’ 

Before he went out the door she asked, * When will I see you 
again?’ 

Michael kissed her. ‘1 want you to go home and think 
things over in that little hick town of yours,* he said. ‘I don’t 
want you to get mixed up in this business in any way. After the 
Qiristmas holidays I’U be back at school and we’ll get together 
up in Hanover. OK?’ 

‘OK,’ she said. She watched him go out the door, saw him 
wave before he stepped into the elevator. She had never felt so 
close to him, never so much in love and if someone had 
told her she would not see Michael again until two years 
|>assed, she would not have been able to bear the angui^ of 


When Michael got out of the c b ifi front of the French 
Hospital he was surprised to see that the street was completely 
deserted. When he entered the hospital he was even more sur- 
prised to find the lobby empty. Damn it, what the hell were 
Qemenza and Tessio doing? Sure, they never went to West 
Point but they knew enough about tacrics to have outposts. 
A couple of their men should have been in the lobby at 
least. 

Even die latest visitors had departed, it was almost ten- 
thirty at night. Michael was tense and alert now. He didn’t 
bother to stop at the mformation desk, he already knew his 
father’s room number up on the fourth floor. He took the self- 
s^icc elevator. Oddly enough nobody stopped him until he 
reached the nurses’ station on the fourth floor. But he strode 
right paist her query and on to his father’s room. There was no 
one outside the door. Where the hell were the two detectives 
who were supposed to be waiting around to guard and ques- 
tion the old man? Where the hell were Tessio and Qemenza’s 
people? Could there be someone inside the room? But die 
door was open. Michael went in. There was a figure in the bed 
and by the December moonlight straining through the 
window Michael could see his fiither’s face. Even now it was 
impassive, the chest heaved shallowly with his uneven breath. 


114 



IVibei faaog fitxm ffted gfdlowv betide ttie bed aod no 
oote. On the floor watt glass jarceoeiviQgtfaepoisotisemptM 
from his stomach by other tubes. Michael stayed diere for a 
few moments to make sure his father was all right, then backed 
out of the room. 

He told the nurse, ^My name is Michael Corleone, 1 just 
want to sit with my father. What ha{>pened to the detectives 
who were supposed to be guarding him?’ 

The nurse was a pretty young tfajng with a great deal of con- 
fidence in the power of her office. *Oh, your fisther just had too 
many visitors, it interfered with the hospital service,’ she said. 
* The police came and made them all leave about ten minutes 
ago. And then just five minutes ago 1 had to call the detectives 
to the phone for an emergency alarm from their headquarters, 
and then they left too. But don’t worry, 1 look in on your 
father often and 1 dm hear any sound from his room. That’s 
why we leave the doors open.* 

'Thank you,’ Michael said. '1*11 sit with him for a little 
while. OK?’ 

She smiled at him. 'Just for a little bit and then I’m aftaid 
you’ll have to leave. It’s the rules, you know.’ 

Michael went back into his father’s room. He took the 
phone from its cradle and got the hospital operator to give 
him the house in Long Beach, the phone in ffie comer office 
rcram. Sonny answered. Michael whispered, 'Sonny, I’m 
down at the hospital, 1 came down late. Sonny, there’s nobody 
here. None of Tessio’s people. No detectives at the door. The 
old tnan was completely unprotected.’ His voice was tremb- 
ling. 

There was a long silence and then Sonny’s voice c^e, low 
and impressed, 'Ibis is Solloazo’s move you were talking 
about.’ 

Michael said, ' That’s what 1 figured too. But how did he get 
the oops to cleu: everybody out and where did they go? W^ 
happened to Tessio’s men? Jesus Christ, has that bastard 
S 0 U 0220 got the New York Police Department in his pocket 
too?* 

'Take k easy, kid.’ Sonny’s voice was soodiing. 'We got 
hicky again wkh you going to visit the hospital so late. Stay in 



the old man’s room. Lock the door from the inside. PU have 
some men there inside of fifreen minutes, soon as 1 make some 
calls. Just sit tight and don’t panic. OK, kid?’ 

‘1 won’t panic,’ Michael said. For the first time since it had 
all started he felt a furious anger rising in him, a cold hatred 
for his father’s enemies. 

He hung up the phone and rang the buzzer for the nurse. He 
decided to use his own judgement and disregard Sonny’s 
orders. When the nurse came in he said, ‘I don’t want you to 
get frightened, but we have to move my father right away. To 
another room or another floor. Can you disconnect all these 
tubes so we can wheel the bed out?’ 

The nurse said, ‘That’s ridiculous. We have to get permis* 
sion from the doctor.’ 

Michael spoke very quickly. ‘You’ve read about my father 
in the papers. You’ve seen that there’s no one here tonight to 
guard him. Now Pve just got word some men will come 
into the hospital to kill him. Please believe me and help me.’ 
He could be extraordinarily persuasive when he wanted to 
be. 

The nurse said, ‘We don’t have to disconnect the tubes. We 
can wheel the stand with the bed.’ 

‘Do you have an empty room?’ Michael whispered. 

‘At the end of the haU,* the nurse said. 

It was done in a matter of moments, very quickly and very 
efficiently. Then Michael said to the nurse, ‘ Stay here with him 
until help comes. If you’re outside at your station you might 
get hurt.’ 

At that moment he heard his father’s voice from the bed, 
hoarse but full of strength, ‘Michael, is it you? What happened, 
what is It?’ 

Michael leaned over the bed. He took his father’s hand in 
his. ‘It’s Mike,’ he said. ‘Don’t be afraid. Now listen, don’t 
make any noise at all, especially if somebody calls out your 
name. Some people want to Idll you, understand? But I’m 
here so don’t be afraid.’ 

Don Corleone, still not fully conscious of what had hap- 
pened to him the day before, in terrible pain, yet smiled bene- 
volently on his youngest son, wanting to tell him, but it was 

126 



too much effort, ‘Why should I be afraid now? Strange men 
have come to kill me ever since I was twelve years old.* 


CHAPTER TEN 


The hospital was small and private with just one entrance. 
Michael looked through the window down into the street. 
There was a curved courtyard that had steps leading down 
into the street and the street was empty of cars. But whoever 
came into the hospital would have to come through that 
entrance. He knew he didn’t have much time so he ran out of 
the room and down the four flights and through the wide 
doors of the ground floor entrance. Off to the side he saw the 
ambulance yard and there was no car there, no ambulances 
cither. 

Michael stood on the sidewalk outside the hospital and lit a 
cigarette. He unbuttoned his coat and stood in light of a 
lamp-post so that his features could be seen. A young man was 
walking swiftly down from Ninth Avenue, a pacl^ge under 
his arm. The young man wore a combat jacket and had a heavy 
shock of black hair. His face was familiar when he came under 
the lamplight but Michael could not place it. But the young 
man stopped in front of him and put out his hand, saying in a 
heavy Italian accent, ‘Don Michael, do you remember me? 
Enzo, the baker’s helper to Nazorine the Paniterra; his son-in- 
law. Your father saved my life by getting the government to 
let me stay in America.* 

Michael shook his hand. He remembered him now. 

Enzo went on, ‘I’ve come to pay my respects to your father. 
Will they let me into the hospital so late?’ 

Michael smiled and shook his head. ‘No, but thanks any- 
way. I’ll tell the Don you came.’ A car came roaring down the 
street and Michael was instantly alert. He said to Enzo, ‘Leave 
here quickly. There may be trouble. You don’t want to get 
involved with the police.’ 

He saw the look of fear on the young Italian’s face. Trouble 



with the police might mean being deported or refusal of 
citizenship. But the young man stood hst. He whispered in 
Italian, ‘If there’s trouble I’ll stay to help. I owe it to the 
Godfather.’ 

Michael was touched. He was about to tell the young man 
to go away again, but then he thought, why not let him stay? 
Two men in front of the hospital might scare off any of Sol- 
lozzo’s crew sent to do a job. One man almost certainly 
would not. He gave Enzo a cigarette and lit it for him. They 
both stood under the lamp-post in the cold December night. 
The yellow panes of the hospital, bisected by the greens of 
Qiristmas decorations, twinkled down on them. They had 
almost finished their cigarettes when a long low black car 
turned into 30th Street from Ninth Avenue and cruised to- 
wards them, very close to the kerb. It almost stopped. Michael 
peered to see the faces inside, his body flinching involun- 
tarily. The car seemed about to stop, then speeded forward. 
Somebody had recognized him. Michael gave Enzo another 
cigarette and noticed that the baker’s hands were shaking. To 
his surprise his own hands were steady. 

They stayed in the street smoking for what was no more 
than ten minutes when suddenly the night air was split by a 
police siren. A patrol car made a screaming turn from Ninth 
Avenue and pulled up in front of the hospital. Two more 
squad cars followed right behind it. Suddenly the hospital 
entrance-way was flooded with uniformed police and de- 
tectives. Michael heaved a sigh of relief. Good old Sonny must 
have got through right away. He moved forward to meet 
them. 

Two huge, burly policemen grabbed his arms. Another 
frisked him. A massive police captain, gold braid on his cap, 
came up the steps, his men parting respectfully to leave a path. 
He was a vigorous man for his girth and despite the white hair 
that peeked out of his cap. His face was beefy red. He came up 
to Michael and said harshly, *I thought 1 got all you guinea 
hoods locked up. Who the hell are you and what are you doing 
here?’ 

One of the cops standing beside Michael 8aid» ‘He’s dean, 
Giptain.’ 


laS 



Michael didn’t answer. He was stadying this police captain, 
coldly searching his fiice, the metallic blue eyes. A detective in 
plain clothes said, ’That’s Michael Corleone, the Don’s son.’ 
Michael said quietly, ’What happened to the detectives who 
were supposed to be guarding my fiather? Who pulled them 
o£F that detail?’ 

The police captain was choleric with rage. ‘You fucking 
hood, who the hell are you to tell me my business? I pulled 
them off. 1 don’t give a shit how many dago gangsters kill each 
other. If it was up to me, I wouldn’t lift a finger to keep your 
old man from getting knocked off. Now get the hell out of 
here. Get out of this street, you punk, and stay out of this 
hospital when it’s not visiting hours.’ 

Michael was still studying him intently. He was not angry at 
what this police captain was saying. His mind was racing 
furiously. Was it possible that SoUozzo had been in that first 
car and had seen him standing in front of the hospital? Was it 
possible that SoUozzo had then called this captain and said, 
’How come the Corleones* men are still around the hospital 
when I paid you to lock them up?’ Was it possible that aU had 
been carefully plaimed as Sonny had said? Everything fitted in. 
Sdll cool, he said to the captain, ’I’m not leaving this hospital 
until you put guards around my father’s room.’ 

The captain didn’t bother answering. He said to the detec- 
tive standing beside him, ’Phil, lock this punk up.’ 

The detective said hesitantly, ’The kid is clean. Captain. 
He’s a war' hero and he’s never been mixed up in the rackets. 
The papers could make a sdnk.’ 

T^c captain started to turn on the detective, his face red 
with fiiry. He roared out, ’Goddamn it, I said lock him up.’ 

Michael, still thinking clearly, not angry, said with de- 
liberate malice, ’How much is the Turk paying you to set my 
father up. Captain?’ 

The police captain turned to him. He said to the two burly 
patrolmen, ’Hold him.’ Michael felt his arms pinned to his 
sides. He saw the captain’s massive fist arching towards his 
face. He tried to weave away but the fist caught him high on 
the cheekbone. A grenade exploded in his skull. His mouth 
fitter! with blood and small hard bones that he realized were his 


119 



teeth. He could feel the side of his head puff up as if it 
were filling with air. His legs were weighdess and he would 
have fidlen if the two policemen had not held him up. But 
he was still conscious. The plainclothes detective had stepped 
in front of him to keep the captain from hitting Um 
again and was saying, ‘Jesus Christ, Captain, you really hurt 
him.’ 

The captain said loudly, ‘I didn’t touch him. He attacked 
me and he fell. Do you understand that? He resisted arrest.’ 

Through a red haze Michael could see more cars pulling up 
to the kerb. Men were getting out. One of them he recognized 
as Clemenza’s lawyer, who was now speaking to the police 
captain, suavely and surely. ‘The Corleone Family has hired a 
firm of private detectives to guard Mr Corleone. These men 
with me are licensed to carry firearms. Captain. If you arrest 
them, you’ll have to appear before a judge in the morning and 
tell him why.* 

The lawyer glanced at Michael. ‘Do you want to prefer 
charges against whoever did this to you?’ he asked. 

Michael had trouble talking. His jaws wouldn’t come to- 
gether but he managed to mumble. *1 slipped,’ he said. *I 
slipped and fell.’ He saw the captain give him a triumphant 
glance and he tried to answer that glance with a smile. At all 
costs he wanted to hide the delicious icy chilliness that con- 
trolled his brain, the surge of wintry cold hatred that pervaded 
his body. He wanted to give no warning to anyone in this 
world as to how he felt at this moment. As the Don would not. 
Then he felt himself carried into the hospital and he lost con- 
sciousness. 

Wl^en he woke up in the morning he found that his jaw had 
been wired together and that four of his teeth along the left 
side of his mouth were missing. Hagen was sitting beside his 
bed. 

‘Did they drug me up?’ Michael asked. 

‘Yeah,’ Hagen said. ‘They had to dig some bone. fragments 
out of your gums and they figured it would be too painful. 
Besides you were practically out anyway.’ 

'Is there anything ebe wrong with me?’ Michael asked. 


130 



*No/ Hagen said. * Sonny wants you out at the Long Beach 
house. Think you can make it?’ 

‘Sure/ Michael said. ‘Is the Don all right?’ 

Hagen flushed. ‘I think weVe solved the problem now. We 
have a Arm of private detectives and we have the whole area 
loaded. 1*11 tell you mote when we get in the car.* 

Clemenza was driving, Michael and Hagen sat in the back. 
Michael’s head throbbed. ‘So what the hell really happened 
last night, did you guys ever And out ? ’ 

Hagen spoke quietly. ‘Sonny has an inside man, that 
Detective Phillips who tried to protect you. He gave us the 
scoop. The police captain, McQuskey, is a guy who’s been on 
the take very heavy ever since he’s been a patrolman. Our 
Family has paid him quite a bit. And he’s greedy and untrust- 
worthy to do business with. But Sollo 2 : 2 o must have paid him 
a big price. McQuskey had all Tessio’s men around and in the 
hospital arrested right after visiting hours. It didn’t help that 
some of them were carrying guns. Then McQuskey pulled the 
official guard detectives ofl the Don’s door. Claimed he needed 
them and that some other cops were supposed to go over and 
take their place but they got their assignments bollixed. 
Baloney. He was paid ofl to set the Don up. And Phillips said 
he’s the kind of guy who’ll try it again. SoUozzo must have 
given him a fortune for openers and promised him the moon 
to come.’ 

‘Was triy getting hurt in the papers?’ 

‘No,’ Hagen said. ‘We kept that quiet. Nobody wants that 
known. Not the cops. Not us.’ 

‘Good,’ Michael said. ‘Did that boy Enxo get away?’ 

‘Yeah,’ Hagen said. ‘He was smarter than you. When the 
cops came be disappeared. He claims he stuck with you while 
Sollozzo’s car went by. Is that true?* 

‘Yeah,’ Michael said. ‘He’s a good kid.’ 

‘He’ll be taken care of,’ Hagen said. ‘You feeling OK?’ His 
face was concerned. ‘You look lousy.’ 

‘I’m OK,’ Michael said. ‘What was that police captain’s 
name?’ 

‘McQuskey,^ Hagen said. ‘By the way, it might make you 
fed better to know that the Corleone Family Ansdly got up 



on the scoreboard. Bruno Tattaglia, four o*clock this morn- 
ing.’ 

Michael sat up. ‘ How come? T thought we were supposed to 
sit tight.’ 

Hagen shrugged. ‘After what happened at the hospital 
Sonny got hard. The button men are out all over New York 
and New Jersey. We made the list last night. Fm trying to hold 
Sonny in, Mike. Maybe you can talk to him. This whole 
business can still be settled without a major war.’ 

‘Fll talk to him,’ Michael said. ‘Is there a conference this 
morning?’ 

‘ Yeah,* Hagen said. ‘ S0II0220 finally got in touch and wants 
to sit down with us. A negotiator is arranging the details. 
That means we win. Sollo220 knows he’s lost and he wants to 
get out with his life.’ Hagen paused. ‘Maybe he thought we 
were soft, ready to be taken, because we didn’t strike back. 
Now with one of the Tattaglia sons dead he knows we mean 
business. He really took an awful gamble bucking the Don. 
By the way, we got the confirmation on Luca. They killed him 
the night before they shot your father. In Bruno’s nightclub. 
Imagine that?’ 

Michael said, ‘No wonder they caught him off guard.’ 

At the houses in Long Beach the entrance to the mall was 
blocked by a long black car parked across its mouth. Two men 
leaned against the hood of the car. The two houses on each 
side, Michael noticed, had opened windows on their upper 
floors. Christ, Sonny must really mean business. 

Clemen2a parked the car outside the mall and they walked 
inside it. The two guards were Clemen2a’s men and he gave 
them a frown of greeting that served aj a salute. The men 
nodded their heads in acknowledgement. There were no 
smiles, no greetings. Clemcnza led Hagen and Michael 
Corleone into the house. 

Tine door was opened by another guard before they rang. 
He had obviously been watching from a window. They went 
to the corner office and found Sonny and Tessip waiting for 
them. Sonny came to Michael, took his younger brother’s head 
in his hands and said kiddingly, ‘Beautiful. Beautiful.* Michael 



knocked bis hands away, and went to the desk and poured 
himself some Scotch, hoping it would dull the ache in his 
wired }aw. 

The five of them sat around the room but the atmosphere 
was different than their earlier meetings. Sonny was gayer, 
more cheerful, and Michael realized w^t that gaiety meant. 
There were no longer any doubts in his older brother’s mind. 
He was committed and nothing would sway him. The attempt 
by Sollo^o the night before was the fiiml straw. There could 
no longer be any question of a truce. 

‘We got a call from the negotiator while you were gone,’ 
Sonny said to Hagen. ‘ The Turk wants a meeting now.’ Sonny 
laughed. ‘ The balls on that son of a bitch,* he said admiringly. 
‘After he craps out last night he wants a meeting today or the 
next day. Meanwhile we’re supposed just to lay back and take 
everything he dishes out. What fucking nerve.’ 

Tom asked cautiously, ‘ What did you answer ? ’ 

Sonny grinned. ‘I said sure, why not? Any time he says, J’m 
in no hurry. I’ve got a hundred button men out on the street 
twenty-four hours a day. If Sollozzo shows one hair on his 
asshole he’s dead. Let them take all the time they want.’ 

Hagen said, ‘Was there a definite proposal?’ 

‘Yeah,’ Sonny said. ‘He wants vis to send Mike to meet him 
to hear his proposition. The negotiator guarantees Mike’s 
safety. Sollozzo doesn’t ask us to guarantee his safety, he 
knows he can’t ask that. No point. So the meeting will be 
arranged on his side. His people will pick Mike up and take 
Mike to the meeting place. Mike will listen to Sollozzo and 
then they’ll turn him loose. But the meeting place is secret. The 
promise is the deal will be so good we can’t turn it down.’ 

Hagen asked, ‘ What about the Tattaglias ? What will they do 
about Bruno?’ 

‘That’s part of the deal. The negotiator says the Tattaglia 
Family has agreed to go along with Sollozzo. They’ll forget 
about Bruno Tattaglia. He pays for what they did to my 
father. One cancels out the other.’ Sonny laughed again. ‘The 
nervy bastards.’ 

Hagen said cautiously, ‘We should hear what they have to 
say.* 


X35 



Sonny shook his head from side to side. 'No, no, Consiglwri^ 
not this time.’ His voice held a faint trace of Italian accent. He 
was consciously mocking his father just to kid around. 'No 
more meetings. No more discussions. No more Sollo22o tricks. 
When the negotiator gets in touch with us again for our 
answer I want you to give him one message. I want Sollozzo. 
If not, it’s all-out war. We’ll go to the mattresses and we’ll put 
all the button men out on the street. Business will just have to 
suffer.’ 

‘ The other Families won’t stand for an all-out war,’ Hagen 
said. ‘It puts too much heat on everybody.* 

Sonny shrugged. ‘They have a simple solution. Give me 
Sollozzo. Or fight the Corleone Family.* Sonny paused, then 
said roughly, ‘No more advice on how to patch it up, Tom. 
The decision is made. Your job is to help me win. Under- 
stand ? ’ 

Hagen bowed his head. He was deep in thought for a 
moment. Then he said, ‘I spoke to your contact in the poUce 
station. He says that Captain McQuskey is definitely on Sol- 
lozzo’s payroll and for big money. Not only that, but 
McCluskey is going to get a piece of the drug operation. 
McCluskey has agreed to be Sollozzo’s bodyguard. The Turk 
doesn’t poke his nose out of his hole without McQuskey. 
When he meets Mike for the conference, McCluskey will be 
sitting beside him. In civilian clothes but carrying his gun. 
Now what you have to understand. Sonny, is that while Sol- 
lozzo is guarded like this, he’s invulnerable. Nobody has ever 
gunned down a New York police captain and got away 
with it. The heat in this town would be unbearable what with 
the newspapers, the whole police department, the churches, 
everything. That would be disastrous. The Families would be 
after you. The Corleone Family would become outcasts. Even 
the old man’s political protection would run for cover. So take 
that into consideration.’ 

Sonny shrugged. ‘McQuskey can’t stay with the Turk for 
ever. We’ll wait.’ 

Tessio and Qemenza were puffing on their cigars uneasily, 
not daring to speak, but sweating. It would be their skins that 
would go on the line if the wrong decision was made. 


134 



' Michael spoke for the first time. He asked Hagen, *Can the 
old man be moved out of the hospital on to the mall here?* 
Hagen shook his head. ‘That’s the first thing I asked. Im- 
possible. He’s in very bad shape. He’ll pull through but he 
needs all kinds of attention, maybe some more surgery. Im- 
possible.’ 

‘Then you have to get SoUozzo right away,’ Michael said. 
‘We can’t wait. The guy is too dangerous. He’ll come up with 
some new idea. Remember, the key is still that he gets rid of 
the old man. He knows that. OK, he knows that now it’s very 
tough so he’s willing to take defeat for his Ufe. But if he’s 
going to get killed anyway, he’ll have another crack at the 
Don. ^nd with that police captain helping him who knows 
what the hell might happen. We can’t take that chance. We 
have to get S0II0220 right away.* 

Sonny was scratching his chin thoughtfully. ‘You’re right, 
kid,’ he said. ‘You got right to the old nuts. We can’t let 
SoUozzo get another crack at the old man.’ 

Hagen said quietly, ‘What about Captain McCluskey?’* 
Sonny turned to Michael with an odd little smile. ‘Yeah, 
kid, what about that tough police captain?’ 

Michael said slowly, ‘OK, it’s an eictreme. But there are 
times when the most extreme measures are justified. Let’s 
think now that we have to kill McCluskey. The way to do it 
would be to have him heavily implicated so that it’s not an 
honest police captain doing his duty but a crooked police 
ofiBcial mixed up in the rackets who got what was coming to 
him, like any crook. We have newspaper people on our pay- 
roU we can give that story to with enough proof so that they 
can back it up. That should take some of the heat off. How 
does that sound?’ Michael looked around defereadaUy to the 
others. Tessio and Oemenza had gloomy faces and reused to 
speak. Sonny said with the same odd smile, ‘Go on, kid, 
you’re doing great. Out of the mouths of infants, as the Don 
always used to say. Go ahead, Mike, teU us more.* 

Hagen was smiling too a little and averting his head. 
Mich^ flushed. ‘WeU, they want me to go to a conference 
with SoUozzo. It wiU be me, SoUozzo and McQuskey aU on 
our own. Set up the meeting for two days from now, ^en get 



our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. 
Insist that it has to be a public place, that I’m not going to let 
them take me into any apartments or houses. Let it be a 
restaurant or a bar at the height of the dinnet hour, something 
like that, so that I’ll feel safe. They’ll feel safe too. Even Sol- 
lozzo won’t figure that we’ll dare to gun the captain. They’ll 
frisk me when 1 meet them so I’ll have to be clean then, but 
figure out a way you can get a weapon to me while I’m meet- 
ing them. Then I’ll take both of them.’ 

All fouz heads turned and stared at him. Clemenza and 
Tcssio were gravely astonished. Hagen looked a little sad but 
not surprised. He started to speak and thought better of it. But 
Sonny, his heavy Cupid’s face twitching with mirth, suddenly 
broke out in loud roars of laughter. It was deep belly laughter, 
not faking. He was really breaking up. He pointed a finger at 
Michael, trying to speak through gasps of mirth. ‘You, the 
high-class college kid, you never wanted to get mixed up in 
the Family business. Now you wanta kill a police captain and 
the Turk just because you got your face smashed by Mc- 
Cluskey. You’re taking it personal, it’s just business and you’re 
taking it personal. You wanta kill these two guys just because 
you got slapped in the face. It was all a lot of crap. All these 
years it was just a lot of crap.’ 

Clemenza and Tessio, completely misunderstanding, think- 
ing that Sonny was laughing at his young brother’s bravado 
for making such an ofier, were also smiling broadly and a little 
patronizingly at Michael. Only Hagen warily kept his face 
impassive. 

Michael looked around at all of them, then stared at Sonny, 
who still couldn’t stop laughing. ‘ You*// take both of them?’ 
Sonny said. ‘Hey, kid, they won’t give you medals, they put 
you in the electric chair. You know that? This is no hero 
business, kid, you don’t shoot people from a mile away. You 
shoot when you see the whites of their eyes like we got taught 
in school, remember? You gotta stand right next to them and 
blow their heads o£F and their brains get all over your nice 
Ivy League suit. How about that, kid, you wanta do that just 
because some dumb cop slapped you around?’ He was still 
laughing. 

156 



Michael stood up. * Yoa*d better stop laughing/ he said. The 
change in him was so extraordinary that the smiles vanished 
ftom the hccB of Qemenxa and Tessio. Michael was not tall or 
heavily built but his presence seemed to radiate danger. In that 
moment he was a reincarnation of Don Corleone himself. His 
eyes had gone a pale tan amd his face was bleached of colour. 
He seemed at any moment about to fling himself on his older 
and stronger brother. There was no doubt that if he had had a 
weapon in his hands Sonny would have been in danger. Sonny 
stopped laughing, and Michael said to him in a cold deadly 
voice, ‘Dbn’t you think I can do it, you son of a bitch?' 

Sonny had got over his laughing fit. ‘I know you can do it,' 
he said. ‘I wasn’t laughing at what you said. I was just laugh- 
ing at how funny things turn out. I always said you were the 
toughest one in the Family, tougher th^ the Don himself. 
You were the only one who could stand off the old man. 1 
remember you when you were a kid. What a temper you had 
then. Hell, you even used to fight me and I was a lot older 
than you. And Freddie had to beat ,the shit out of you at least 
once a week. And now Sollozzo has you figured for the soft 
touch in the Family because you let McQuskey hit you without 
fighting back and you wouldn’t get mixed up in the Family 
fights. He figures he got nothing to worry al^ut if he meets 
you head to head. And McCluskey too, he’s got you figured 
for a yellow guinea.’ Sonny paused and then said softly, 'But 
you’re a Corleone after all, you son of a bitch. Aind 1 was the 
only one who knew it. I’ve been sitting here waiting for the 
last three days, ever since the old man got shot, waiting for 
you to crack out of that Ivy League, war hero bullshit character 
you’ve been wearing. I’ve been waiting for you to become my 
right arm so we can kill those fucks that are trying to destroy 
our father and our Family. And all it took was a sock on the 
jaw. How do you like that?' Sonny made a comical gesture, a 
punch, and repeated, 'How do you like that?’ 

The tension had relaxed in the room. Mike shook his head. 
'Sonny, I’fn doing it because it’s the only thing to do. I can’t 
give Siollozzo another crack at the old man. 1 seem to be the 
only one who can get close enough to him. And I figured it 
out. I don't think you can get anybody else to knock oS a 


*57 



police captain. Maybe you would do it» Sonny, but you have a 
wife and kids and you have to run the Family business until 
the old man is in shape. So that leaves me and Freddie. Freddie 
is in shock and out of action. Finally that leaves just me. It’s all 
logic. The sock on the jaw had nothing to do with it.* 

Sonny came over and embraced him. ‘ I don’t give a damn 
what your reasons are, just so long as you’re with us now. And 
m tell you another thing, you’re right all the way, Tom, 
what’s your say?* 

Hagen shrugged. 'The reasoning is solid. What makes it so 
is that I don’t think the Turk is sincere about a deal. I think 
he’ll still try tq get at the Don. Anyway on his past perfor- 
mance that’s how we have to figure him. So we try to get 
Sollozzo. We get him even if we have to get the police captain. 
But whoever does the job is going to get an awful lot of heat. 
Does it have to be Mike?’ 

Sonny said softly, ‘ I could do it.* 

Hagen shook his head impatiently. ‘SoHozzo wouldn’t let 
you get within a mile of him if he had ten police captains. And 
besides you’re the acting head of the Family. You can’t be 
risked.’ Hagen paused and said to Clcmenza and Tessio, 'Do 
either one of you have a top button man, someone really 
spexial, who would take on this job? He wouldn’t have to 
worry about money for the rest of his life.’ 

Qemenza spoke first. 'Nobody that Sollozzo wouldn’t 
know, he’d catch on right away. He’d catch on if me or Tessio 
went too.* 

Hagen said, 'What about somebody really tough who hasn’t 
made his rep yet, a good rookie?’ 

Both caporegtmes shook their heads. Tessio smiled to take the 
sting out of liis words and said, 'Hiat’s like bringing a guy up 
from the minors to pitch the World Scries.’ 

Sonny broke in curtly, 'It has to be Mike. For a million 
different reasons. Most important they got him down as faggy. 
And he can do the job, I guarantee that, and that’s important 
because this is the only shot we’ll get at that sneaky bastard 
Turk. So now we have to figure out the best way to back him 
up. Tom, Qemenza, Tessio, find out where Sollozzo will take 
him for the conference, I don’t care how much it costs. When 

138 



we find that out we can figute out how we can get a weapon 
into hia hands. Qemenaa, I want you to get him a really safe*’ 
gun out of your collection, the ** coldest” one you got. Im- 
possible to trace. Try to make it short barrel with a lot of blast- 
ing power. It doesn’t have to be accurate. He’ll be right on top 
of them when he uses it. Mike, as soon as you’ve used the gun, 
drop it on the floor. Don’t be caught with it on you. Qemenza^ 
tape the barrel and the trigger with that special stuil you got so 
he won’t leave prints. Remember, Mike, we can square every- 
thing, witnesses, and so forth, but if they catch you with the 
gun on you we can’t square that. We’ll have transportation and 
protection and then we’ll make you disappear for a nice long 
vacation until the heat wears oflT. You’ll be gone a long time, 
Mike, but 1 don’t want you saying goodbye to your girlfriend 
or even calling her. After it’s all over and you’re out of the 
country I’ll send her word that you’re OK. Those are orders/ 
Sonny smiled at his brother. ‘Now stick with Qemenaa and 
get used to handling the gun he picks out for you. Maybe even 
practise a little. We’ll take care of everything else. Everything. 
OK, kid?’ 

Again Michael Corleone felt that delicious refreshing chil- 
liness all over his body. He said to his brother, ‘You didn’t 
have to give me that crap about not talking to my girlfrieod 
about something like this. What the hell did you think 1 was 
going to do, call her up to say goodbye?’ 

Sonny said hastily, ‘OK, but you’re still a rookie so I spell 
things out. Forget it.’ 

Michael said with a grin, ‘What the hell do you mean, a 
rookie? I listened to the old man just as hard as you did. How 
do you think I got so smart?’ They both laughed. 

Hagen poured drinks for everyone. He looked a little glum. 
The statesman forced to go to war, the lawyer forced to go to 
law. ‘ Well, anyway now we know what we’re going to do,’ he 
said. 



CHAPTER ELEVEN 


Captain Mark McCluskey sat in his office fingering three 
envelopes bulging with betting slips^ He was frowning and 
wishing he could decode the notations on the slips. It was very 
important that he do so. The envelopes were the betting slips 
that his raiding parties had picked up when they had hit one of 
the Corleone Family bookmakers the night before. Now the 
bookmaker would have to buy back the slips so that players 
couldn’t claim winners and wipe him out. 

It was very important for Captain McCluskey to decode the 
slips because he didn’t want to get cheated when he sold the 
slips back to the bookmaker. If there was fifty grand worth of 
action, then maybe h^ could sell it back for five grand. But if 
there were a lot of iieavy bets and the slips represented a 
hundred grand or maybe even two hundred grand, then the 
price should be considerably higher. McCluskey fiddled with 
the envelopes and then decided to let the bookie sweat a little 
bit and make the first offer. That might tip ofi what the real 
price should be. 

McCluskey looked at the station house clock on the wall of 
his office. It was time for him to pick up that greasy Turk, 
SoUozzo, and take him to wherever he was going to meet the 
Corleone Family. McCluskey went over to his wall locker and 
started to change into his civilian clothes. When be was 
finished he called his wife and told her he would not be home 
for sapper that night, that he would be out on the job. He 
never confided in his wife on anything. She thought they lived 
the way they did on his policeman’s salary. McCluskey grunted 
with amusement. His mother had thought the same thing but 
he had learned early, flis father had shown him the ropes. 

His father had been a police sergeant, and every week father 
and son had walked though the precinct and McQuskey 
Senior had introduced his six-year-old son to the storekeepers, 
saying, ‘And this is my little boy.* 

The storekeepers would shake his hand and compliment 

140 



him extravagantly and dng open their cash registers to give the 
little boy a gift of five or ten dollars. At the end of the day, 
little Mark McCuskey would have all the pockets of his suit 
stuffed with paper money, would feel so proud that his fiither*s 
friends liked him well enough to give him a present every 
month they saw him. Of course his father put the money in the 
bank for him, for his college education, and little Mark got at 
most a fifty-ccnt piece for himself. 

Then when Mark got home and his policemen uncles asked 
him what he wanted to be when he grew up and he would lisp 
childishly, ‘A policeman,* they would all laugh uproariously. 
And of course later on, though his father wanted him to go to 
college first, he went right from high school to studying for 
the police force. 

He had been a good cop, a brave cop. The tough young 
punks terrorizing street corners fled ^hen he approached and 
finally vanished from his beat altog ^ther. He was a very tough 
cop and a very fair one. He never took his son around to ^e 
storekeepers to collect his money presents for ignoring gar- 
bage violations and parking violations; he took the money 
directly into his own hand, direct because he felt he earned it. 
He never ducked into a movie house or goofed off into res- 
taurants when he was on foot patrol as some of the other cops 
did, especially on winter nights^ He always made his rounds. 
He gave his stores a lot of protection, a lot of service. When 
winos and drunks filtered up from the Bowery to panhandle 
on his beat he got rid of them so roughly that they never came 
back. The tradespeople in his precinct appreciated it. And they 
showed their appreciation. 

He also obeyed the system. The bookies in ^ his prednet 
knew he would never make trouble to get an extra payoff for 
himself, that he was content for his share of the station house 
bag. His name was on the li^t with the others and he never 
tried to make extras. He was a fair cop who took only clean 
graft and his rise in the police department was steady if not 
spectacular. 

During this time he was raising a large family of four sons, 
none of whom became policemen. They all w6nt to Fordham 
University and since by that time Mark McOuskey was rising 


141 



from sergeant to lieutenant and finally to captain, they lacked 
for nothing. It was at this time that McQuskey got the reputa- 
tion for being a hard bargainer. The bookmakers in his district 
paid more protection money than the bookmakers in any other 
part of the city, but maybe that was because of the expense of 
putting four boys through coUege. 

McQuskey himself felt there was nothing wrong with clean 
graft. Why the hell should his kids go to CCNY oi a cheap 
Southern college just because the Police Department didn’t 
pay its people enough money to live on and take care of their 
families properly with? He protected all these people with his 
life and his record showed his dtations for gun duels with 
stick-up men on his beat, strong-arm protection guys, would- 
b^ pimps. He had hammered them into the ground. He had 
jtept his little corner of the city safe for ordinary people and he 
sure as hell was entided to more than his lousy one C note a 
week. But he wasn’t indignant about his low pay, he under- 
stood that everybody had to take care of themselves. 

Bruno Tattaglia was an old friend of his. Bruno had gone to 
Fordham with one of his sons and then Bruno had opened his 
nightclub and whenever the McQuskey family spent an in- 
frequent night on the town, they could enjoy the cabaret with 
liquor and dinner - on the house. On New Year’s Eve they 
received engraved invitations to be guests of the management 
and always received one of the best tables. Bruno always nuide 
sure they were introduced to the celebrities who performed in 
his club, some of them famous singers and Holl3rwood stars. 
Of course sometimes he asked a little favour, like getting an 
employee with a record cleared for a cabaret work licence, 
usuaUy a pretty girl with a police dossier as a hustler or roller. 
McQuskey would be glad to oblige. 

McQuskey made it a policy never to show that he under- 
stood what other people were up to. When Sollozzo had 
approached him with the proposition to leave old man Cor^ 
leone uncovered in the hospital, McQuskey didn’t ask why. 
He asked price. When Sollozzo said ten grand, McQuskey 
knew why. He did not hesitate. Q>rleone was one of the 
biggest b^fia men in the country with more political connex- 
ions than Gqxme had ever had. Whoever knocked him ofi 



would be doing the country a big favour. McCluskey took the 
money in advance and did the job. When he received a call 
from Sollozzo that there were still two of Corleone’s men in 
front of the hospital he had flown into a rage. He had locked 
up all of Tessio *8 men, he had pulled the detective guards off 
the door of Coileone’s hospital room. And now, being a man 
of principle, he would have to give back the ten grand, money 
be had already earmarked to insure the education of his grand* 
children. It was in that rage that he had gone to the hospital 
and struck Michael Corleone. 

But it had all worked out for the best. He had met with 
S0II0220 in the Tattaglia nightclub and they had made an even 
better deal. Again McCluskey didn’t ask questions, since he 
knew all the answers. He just made sure of his ptice. It never 
occurred to him that he himself could be in any danger. That 
anyone would consider even for a moment killing a New York 
Qty police captain was too fantastic. The toughest hood in the 
MadBa had to stand still if the lowliest patrolman decided to 
slap him arotind. There was absolutely no percentage in 
killing cops. Because then all of a sudden a lot of hoods were 
killed resisting arrest or escaping the scene of a crime, and who 
the hell was going to do anything about that ? 

McQuskey sighed and got ready to leave the station bouse. 
Problems, always problems. His wife’s sister in Ireland bad 
just died after many years of fighting cancer and that cancer 
had cost him a pretty penny. Now the funeral would cost him 
more. His own uncles and aunts in the old country needed a 
little help now and then to keep their potato farms and he sent 
the money to do the trick. He didn’t begrudge it. And when he 
and his wife visited the old country they were treated like a 
king and queen. Maybe they would go again this summer now 
that the war was over and with all this extra money coming in. 
McQuskey told his patrolman clerk where he would be if he 
was needed. He did not feel it necessary to take any precautions. 
He could always claim Sollozzo was an informer he was meeting. 
Outside the station house he walked a few blocks and then 
caught a cab to the house where he would meet with Sollozzo. 

It was Tom Hagen who had to make all the arrangements 



for Michael’s leaving the country, his fidse passport, his sea- 
man’s card, his berth on an Italian freighter that would dock 
in a Sicilian port. Emissaries were sent that very day by plane 
to Sicily to prepare a hiding place with the Ma& chief in the 
hill country. 

Sonny arranged for a car and an absolutely trustworthy 
driver to be waiting for Michael when he stepped out of the 
restaurant where the meeting would be held with Sollozzo. 
The driver would be Tessio himself, who had volunteered for 
the job. It would be a beat-up-looking, cat but with a fine 
motor. It would have phony licence plates and the car itself 
would be untraceable. It had been saved for a special job 
requiring the best. 

Michael spent the day with Qemenza, practising with the 
small gun ti^ would be got to him. It was a .22 filled with 
soft-nosed bullets that made pinpricks going in and left in- 
sulting gaping holes when they exited from the human body. 
He found that it was accurate up to five of his steps away from 
a target. After that the bullets might go anywhere. The trigger 
was tight but Qememi^ worked on this with some tools so 
that it pulled easier. They decided to leave it noisy. They 
didn’t want an innocent bystander misunderstanding the situ- 
ation and interfering out of ignorant courage. The report of 
the gun would keep them away from Michael. 

Clemenza kept instructing him during the training session. 
‘Drop the gun as soon as you’ve finished using it. Just let your 
hand drop to your side and the gun slip out. Nobody will 
notice. Everybody will think you’re still armed. They’ll be 
staring at your free. Walk out of the place very quickly but 
don’): run. Don’t look anybody directly in the eye but don’t 
look away from them either. Remember, they’ll be scared of 
you, believe me, they’ll be scared of you. Nobody will inter- 
fere. As soon as you’re outside Tessio will be in the car waiting 
for you. Get in and leave the rest to him. Don’t be worried 
about accidents. You’d be surprised how well these afEairs go. 
Now put this hat on and let’s see how you look.’ He clapped a 
grey fedora on Michael’s head. Michael, who never wore a hat; 
grimaced; Qemenaa reassured him. *It helps against identifi- 
cation, just in case. Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to 


144 



change thek identificatioii when we make them see the light. 
Remember, Mike, don’t worry about prints. The butt and 
trigger are fixed with special tape. Don’t touch any other part 
of the gun, remember that.’ 

Michael said, ‘Has Sonny found out where SoUozzo is 
taking me?’ 

Gemenza shrugged. ‘Not yet. Sollozzo is being very careful. 
But don’t worry about him harming you. The negotiator stays 
in our hands until you come back safe. If anything happens to 
you, the negotiator pays.’ 

‘Why the hell should he stick his neck out?’ Michael asked. 

‘He gets a big fee,’ Gemenza said. ‘A small fortune. Also he 
is an important man in the Families. He knows Sollozzo can’t 
let anything happen to him. Your life Is not worth the nego- 
tiator’s life to Sollozzo. Very simple. You’ll be safe all right. 
We’re the ones who catch hell afterwards.’ 

‘How bad will it be?’ Michael asked. 

‘Very bad,’ Gemenza said. ‘It means an all-out war with the 
TattagUa Family against the Corleone Family. Most of the 
others will line up with the Tattaglias. The Sanitation De^MUt- 
ment will be sweeping up a lot of dead bodies this winter.’ He 
ihrugged. ‘These things have to happen once every ten years 
or so. It gets rid of the bad blood. And then if we let them push 
os around on the little things they wanta take over everyt^g. 
You gotta stop them at the beginning. Like th^ shoulda 
stopped Hitler at Munich, they should never let him get away 
widi that, they were just asking for big trouble when they 1^ 
him get away with that.’ 

Michael had heard his finther say this same thing before, only 
in 1939 before the war actually started. If the J^amilies had 
been running the State Department there would never have 
been World War II, he thought with a grin. 

They drove back to the m^ and to the Don’s house, where 
Sonny still made his headquarters. Michael wondered how 
long Sonny could stay cooped up in the safe territory of the 
mall. Eventually, he would have to venture out. They found 
Sonny taking a nap on the couch. On the cofiee table were the 
remains of his late lunch, scraps of steak and breadcrumbs and 
a half-empty bottle of whisky. 


*45 



His father’s usuaUy neat office was taking on the look of a 
badly kept furnished room. Michael shook his brother awake 
and saidy * Why don’t you stop living like a bum and get this 
place cleaned up.’ 

Sonny yawned. *What the hell are you, inspecting the 
barracks? Mike, we haven’t got the word yet where they plan 
to take you, those bastards SoUozao and McQuskey. If we 
don’t find that out, how the hell are we going to get the gun to 
you?’ 

*Can’t I carry it on me?’ Michael asked. ‘Maybe they won’t 
frisk me and even if they do maybe they’ll miss it if we’re 
smart enough. And even if they find it - so what. They’ll just 
take it off me and no harm done.* 

Sonny shook his head. ‘Nah,’ he said. ‘We have to make this 
a sure hit on that bastard SoUoszo. Remember, get him Rrst if 
you possibly can. McQuskey is slower and dumber. You 
should have plenty of time to take him. Did Qemenza tell you 
to be sure to drop the gun?’ 

‘A million times,’ Michael said. 

Sonny got up from the sofa and stretched. ‘How does your 
jaw feel, kid?’ 

‘Lousy,’ Michael said. The left side of his face ached except 
those parts that felt numb because of the drugged wire holding 
it together. He took the bottle of whisky from the tabic and 
swigged directly from it. The pain eased. 

Sonny said, ‘ Easy, Mike, now is no time to get slowed up by 
booze.’ 

Michael said, *Oh, Qirist, Sonny, stop playing the big 
brother. I’ve been in combat against tougher guys than Sob 
lozzo and under worse conditions. Where the hell ate his 
mortars? Has he got air cover? Heavy artillery? Land mines? 
He’s just a wise son of a bitch with a big-wheel cop sidekick. 
Once anybody makes up their mind to kill them there’s no 
other problem. That’s the hard part, making up your mind. 
Thcy’U never know what hit them.’ 

Tom Hagen came into the room. He greeted them with a 
nod and went directly to the falsely-listed telephone. He called 
a few times and then shook his head at Sonny. ‘Not a whisper,’ 
he said. ‘Sollozzo is keeping it to himself as long as he can.’ 

146 



The phone rang. Sonny antweted it and he held up a hand 
as if to signal for quiet though no one had spoken. He jotted 
some notes down on a pad» tl^ said, ‘OK, he’ll be there,’ and 
hung up the phone. 

Sonny was laughing. ‘That son of a bitch Sollozzo, he really 
is something. Here’s the deal. At eight tonight he and Captain 
McQuskey pick up Mike in front of Jack Dempsey’s bar on 
Broadway. They go some place to talk, and get this. Mike and 
SoUozzo talk in Italian so that the Irish cop don’t know what 
the hell they are talking about. He even tells me, don’t worry, 
he knows McQuskey doesn’t know one word in Italian unless 
it’s ** soldi** and he’s checked you out, Mike, and knows you 
can understand Sicilian dialect.’ 

Michael said dryly, ‘I’m pretty rusty but we won’t talk 
long.* 

Tom Hagen said, ‘We don’t let Mike go until we have the 
negotiator. Is that arranged?* 

Qemenza nodded. ‘ The negotiator is at my house playing 
pinochle with three of my men. They wait for a call from me 
before they let him go.’ 

Sonny sank back in the leather armchair. ‘Now how the hell 
do we ^d out the meeting place? Tom, we’ve got informers 
with the Tattaglia Family, how come they haven’t given us the 
word?’ 

Hagen shrugged. ‘Sollozzo is really damn smart. He’s play- 
ing this close to the vest, so close that he’s not using any men 
as a cover. He figures the captain will be enough and that 
security is more important than guns. He’s right too. We’ll 
have to put a tail on Mike and hope for the best.’ 

Sonny shook his head. ‘Nah, anybody can lose a tail when 
they really want to. 'iTiat’s the first thing they’ll check out.’ 

By this time it was five in the afternoon. Sonny, with a 
worried look on his face, said, ‘Maybe we should just let Mike 
blast whoever is in the car when it tries to pick him up.’ 

Hagen shook his head. ‘What if SoUozzo is not m the car? 
We’ve tipped our hand for nothing. Damn it, we have to find 
out where SoUozzo is taking him.’ 

Qcmenza put in, ‘Maybe we should start trying to figure 
why he’s making it such a big secret’ 


*47 



Michad said impatiently, 'Because it*s the percentage. Why 
should he let us know anything if he can prevent it? Besides, 
he smells danger. He must be leery as hell even with that police 
captain for his shadow.’ 

Hagen snapped his fingers. 'That detective, that guy 
Phillips. Why don’t you give him a ring. Sonny? Maybe he 
can find out where the hell the captain can be reached. It’s 
worth a try. McCluskey won’t give a damn who knows where 
he’s going.’ 

Sonny picked up the phone and dialled a number. He spoke 
softly into the phone, then himg up. ‘He’ll call us back,’ 
Sonny said. 

They waited for nearly another thirty minutes and then the 
phone rang. It was Phillips. Sonny jotted something down on 
his pad and then hung up. His face was taut. ‘I think we’ve got 
it,’ he said. 'Giptain McCluskey always has to leave word on 
where he can be reached. From eight to ten tonight he’ll be at 
the Luna Azure up in the Bronx. Anybody know it?’ 

Tessio spoke confidently. 'I do. It’s perfect for us. A small 
family place with big booths where people can talk in private. 
Good food. Everybody minds their own business. Perfect.’ 
He leaned over Sonny’s desk and arranged stubbed*out 
cigarettes into map figures. ‘This is the entrance. Mike, when 
you finish just walk out and turn left, then turn the corner. I’ll 
spot you and put on my headlights and catch you on the fly. If 
you ^ve any trouble, yell and I’ll try to come in and get you 
out. Gemenza, you gotta work fast. Send somebody up there 
to plant the gun. They got an old-fashioned toilet with a space 
between the water container and the wall. Have your man 
tape the gun behind there. Mike, after they frisk you in the car 
and find you’re clean, they won’t be too worried about you. In 
the restaurant, wait a bit before you excuse yourself. No, 
better still, ask permission to go. Act a little in trouble first, 
very natural. They can’t figure anything. But when you come 
out again, don’t waste any time. Don’t sit down again at the 
table, start blasting. And don’t take chances. In the head, two 
shots apiece, and out as fast aft your legs can travel.’ 

Sonny had been listening judiciously. ‘I want somebody 
very good, very safe, to plant that gun,’ he told Gemenza. ‘I 

X48 



don’t wuit my bfothor coming out of tibat toikt wUi }u8t fab 
dick in hb hand.’ 

Qemenza said emphaticaUy, ^The gun will be tibete.’ 

^OK,’ Sonny said. ‘Everybody get rolling.’ 

Tessio and Clemenm left. Tom Hagen said, ‘ Sonny, should 
1 drive Mike down to New York?’ 

‘No,’ Sonny said. ‘I want you here. When Mike finishes, 
then our work begins and I’ll need you. Have you got those 
newspaper guys lined up?’ 

Hagen nodded. ‘ I’ll be feeding them info as soon as things 
break.’ 

Sonny got up and came to stand in front of Michael. He 
shook his hand. ‘OK, kid,’ he said, ‘you’re on. I’ll square it 
with Mom your not seeing her before you left. And I’ll get a 
message to your girlfriend when 1 think the time u right 
OK?’ 

‘OK,* Mike said. ‘How long do you think before 1 can 
comeback?’ 

‘At least a year,’ Sonny said. 

Tom Hagen put in, 'The Don might be able to work &8ter 
than that, Mike, but don’t count on it. The time element 
hinges on a lot of factors. How well we can plant stories with 
efae newsmen. How much the Police Department wants to 
cover up. How violently the other Families react. There’s 
going to be a hell of a lot of heat and trouble. That’s the only 
thing we can be sure of.’ 

Michael shook Hagen’s hand. ‘Do your best,’ he said. ‘I 
don’t want to do another three>year stretch away from home.* 

Hagen said gently, ‘It’s not too late to back out, Mike, we 
can get somebody dse, we can go back over our ^ternatives. 
Maybe it’s not necessary to get rid of Sollozzo.’ 

li^chael laughed. ‘We can talk ourselves into any view- 
point,’ he said. ‘But we figured it right the first time. I’ve been 
riding the gravy train all my life, it’s about time I paid my 
dues.’ 

‘You shouldn’t let that broken jaw influence you,’ Hagen 
said. ‘McQuskey is a stupid man and it was business, not 
personal.’ 

For the second time he saw Michael Q>rleQne’s face freeze 

M9 



into a mask that tcsembled uncannily the Don’s. *Tom» don’t 
let anybody kid you. It’s all personal, every bit of business. 
Every piece of shit every man has to eat every day of his life is 
personal. They call it business. OK. But it’s personal as hell. 
You know where 1 learned that from? The Don. My old man. 
The GodBither. If a bolt of lightning hit a friend of his the old 
man would take it personal. He took my going into the 
Marines personal. That’s what makes him great. The Great 
Don. He takes everything personal. Like God. He knows 
every feather that fsdls from the tail of a sparrow or however 
the hell it goes. Right? And you know something? Accidents 
don’t happen to people who take accidents as a personal insult. 
So I came late, OK, but I’m coming all the way. Damn right, I 
take that broken jaw personal; damn right, I take S0U0220 
trying to kill my father personal.’ He laughed. 'Tell the old 
man I lesuned it all from him and that I’m glad I had this 
chance to pay him back for all he did for me. He was a good 
father.’ He paused and then he said thoughtfully to Hagen, 
'You know, I can never remember him hitting me. Or Sonny. 
Or Freddie. And of course Connie, he wouldn’t even yell at 
her. And tell me the truth, Tom, how many men do you figure 
the Don killed or had killed.’ 

Tom Hagen turned away. 'I’ll tell you one thing you didn’t 
learn from him: talking the way you’re talking now. There are 
things that have to be done and you do them and you never 
talk about them. You don’t try to justify them. They can’t be 
justified. You just do them. Then you forget it.’ 

Michael Corleone frowned. He said quietly, 'As the 
Consigliori^ you agree that it’s dangerous to the Don and our 
Family to let SoUozzo live?’ 

‘Yes,’ Hagen said. 

'OK,’ Michael said. 'Then I have to kill him. 

Michael Corleone stood in front of Jack Dempsey’s restau- 
rant on Broadway and waited for his pickup. He looked at his 
watch. It said five minutes to eight. Sollozzo was going to be 
punctual. Michael had made sure he was there in plenty of 
time. He had been waiting fifteen minutes. 

All during dbe ride from Long Beach into the city he had 


150 



been tqrifig to forget what he had said to Hagen. For if he 
helieved what he said, then his life was set on an irrerocahlc 
course. And yet, could it be otherwise after tonight? He 
might be dead after tonight if he didn't stop all this crap, 
Michael thought grimly. He had to keep his mind on the 
business at hand. Soilozzo was no dummy and McQuskcy was 
a very tough egg. He felt the ache in his vnred jaw and wel- 
comed the pain, it would keep him alert. 

Broadway vrasn’t that crowded on this cold winter night, 
even though it was near theatre time. Michael flinched as a 
long black car pulled up to the kerb and the driver, leaning 
over, opened front door and said, ‘Get in, Mike.* He 
didn't know the driver, a young punk with slick black hair 
and an open shut, but he got in. In the back seat were Captain 
McQuskey and Soilozzo. 

Soilozzo reached a hand over the back of the seat and 
Michael shook if. The hand was Arm, warm and dry. Soilozzo 
said, ‘I*m glad you came, Mike. I hope we can straighten 
everything out. All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted 
things to happen at ail. It should never have happened.* 
Michael C.orleone said quietly, ‘I hope we can settle things 
tonight, 1 don’t want my father bothered any more.* 

‘He won’t be,* Soilozzo said sincerely. ‘1 swear to you by 
my children he won’t be. Just keep an open mind when we 
.talk. 1 hope you’re not a hothead like your brother Sonny. It’s 
impCssible to talk business with him.’ 

Optain Meduskey grunted. ‘He’s a good kid, he’s all 
right.’ He leaned over to give Michael an affectionate pat on 
the shoulder. ‘I’m sorry about the other night, Mike. I’m 
getting too old for my job, too grouchy. 1 guess I’ll have to 
retire pretty soon. Can’t stand the aggravation, all day 1 get 
aggravation. You know how it is.’ Then with a dolefiil sigh, 
he gave Michael a thorough frisk for a weapon. 

I^diad saw a slight sn^e on the driver’s lips. The car was 
going west with no apparent attempt to elude any trailers. It 
went up on to the West Side Highway, speeding in and out of 
traffic. Anyone following would have had to do the same. 
Then to Mchael’s dismay it took the exit for the George 
Washington Bridge, they were going over to New Jersey. 


*51 



Whoever had given Sonny the info on where the meeting was 
to be held had given him the wrong dope. 

The car threaded through the bridge approaches and then 
was on it, leaving the blaaing city behind. Michael kept his hice 
impassive. Were they going to dump him into the swamps or 
was It just a last-minute change in meeting place by the wily 
S0II0Z20? But when they were nearly all the way across, the 
driver gave the wheel a violent twist. The heavy automobile 
jumped into the air when it hit the divider and bounced over 
into the lanes going back to New York City. Both McCluskey 
and S0II0220 were looking back to see if anyone had tried 
doing the same thing. The driver was really hitting it back to 
New York and then they were off the bridge and going to- 
wards the East Bronx. They went through side streets with no 
cars behind them. By this time it was nearly nine o'clock. They 
had made sure there was no one on their tail. S0II0220 lit up a 
cigarette after offering his pack to McQuskey and Michael, 
both of whom refused. S0II0220 said to the driver, ‘Nice 
work. I’ll remember it.’ 

Ten minutes later the car pulled up in front of a restaurant 
in a small Italian neighbourhood. There was no one on the 
streets and because of the lateness of the hour only a few people 
were still at dinner. Michael had been worried that the driver 
would come in with them, but he stayed outside with his car. 
The negotiator had not mentioned a driver, nobody had. 
Technically Sollozzo had broken the agreement by bringing 
him along. But Michael decided not to mention it, knowing 
they would think he would be afraid to mention it, afraid of 
ruining the chances for the success of the parley. 

The three of them sat at the only round table, Sollozzo re- 
fusing a booth. There were only two other people in the 
restaurant. Michael wondered whether they were Sollozzo 
plants. But it didn’t matter^ Before they could interfere it 
would be all over. 

McCluskey asked with real interest, ‘Is the Italian food 
good here?’ 

Sollozzo reassured him. ‘Try the veal, it’s the finest in New 
York.’ The solitary waiter had brought a bottle of wine to the 
table and uncork^ it. He poured three ghiMfi fiilL Sur- 





priflingly McQuskey did not drink* *I must be the only Irish- 
man who don’t take the boo 2 e/ he said. ‘1 seen too many good 
people get in trouble because of the booze.’ 

Sollozzo said placatingly to the captain, *1 am going to talk 
Italian to Mike, not because I don’t trust you but because 1 
can’t explain myself properly in English and I want to con- 
vince Mike that 1 mean well, that it’s to everybody’s advantage 
for us to come to an agreement tonight. Don’t be insulted by 
this, it’s not that I don’t trust you.’ 

Giptain McCluskey gave them both an ironic grin. ‘Sure, 
you two go right ahead,’ he said. ‘I’U concentrate on my veal 
and spaghetti.’ 

Solloz 20 began speaking to Michael in rapid Sicilian. He 
said, ‘You must understand that what happened between me 
and your father was strictly a business matter. I have a great 
respect for Don Corleone and would beg for the opportunity 
to enter his service. But you must understand that your father 
is an old-fashioned man. He stands in the way of progress. The 
business I am in is the coming thing, the wave of the future, 
there are untold millions of dollars for everyone to make. But 
your father stands in the way because of certain unrealistic 
scruples. By doing this he imposes his will on men like myself. 
Yes, yes, I know, he says to me, “Go ahead, it’s your 
business,” but we both know that is unrealistic. We must tread 
on each other’s corns. What he is really telling me is that 1 
cannot operate my business. 1 am a man who respects himself 
and cannot let another man impose his will on me so what had 
to happen did happen. Let me say that I had the support, the 
silent support of all the New York Families. And the Tattaglia 
Family became my partners. Ifthis quarrel continues, then the 
Corleone Family will stand alone against everyone. Perhaps if 
your hither were well, it could be done. But the eldest son is 
not the man the Godfather is, no disrespect intended. And the 
Irish Consigliwriy Hagen, is not the man Genco Abbandando 
was, God rest his soul. So I propose a peace, a truce. Let us 
cease all hostilities until your father is weU again and can take 
part in these bargainings. The Tattaglia Family agrees, upon 
my persuasions and my indemnities, to forgo justice for their 
son Bruno. We will have peace. Meanwhile, 1 have to make a 


*53 



living and will do a little trading in my business. 1 do not ask 
your cooperation but 1 ask you, the Corleone Family, not to 
interfere. These are my proposals. I assume you have the 
authority to agree, to make a deal.’ 

Michael said in Sicilian, *Tell me more about how you 
propose to start your business, exactly what part my Family 
has to play in it and what profit we can take from this busi- 
ness.’ 

‘You want the whole proposition in detail then?* Sollo 2 zo 
asked. 

Michael said gravely, ‘Most important of all I must have 
sure guarantees that no more attempts will be made on my 
father’s life.’ 

S0II0220 raised his hand expressively. ‘ What guarantees can 
1 give you? I’m the hunted one. I’ve missed my chance. You 
think too highly of me, my friend. I am not that clever.’ 

Michael was sure now that the conference was only to gain a 
few days* time. That Soilo2zo would make another attempt to 
kill the Don. What was beautiful was that the Turk was under- 
rating him as a punk kid. Michael felt that strange delicious 
chill filling his body. He made his face look distressed. Sol- 
lo220 asked sharply, ‘What is itr’ 

Michael said with an embarrassed air, ‘The wine went right 
to my bladder. I’ve been holding it in. Is it all right if I go to 
the bathroom.’ 

Sollo220 was searching his face intently with his dark eyes. 
He reached over and roughly thrust liis hand in Michael’s 
crotch, under it and around, searching for a weapon. Michael 
looked ofiended. McQuskey said curtly, ‘1 frisked him. I’ve 
frisked thousands of young punks. He’s clean.’ 

Spllozzo didn't like it. For no reason at all he didn’t like ft. 
He glanced at the man sitting at a table opposite them 
and raised his eyebrows towards the door of the bathroom. 
The man gave a slight nod that he had checked it, that 
there was nobody inside. SoUozzo said reluctantly, ‘Don’t 
take too long.’ He had marvellous antennae, he was 
nervous. 

Michael got up and went into the bathroom. The urinal had 
a pink bar ^ soap in it secured by a wire net. He went into the 


154 



booth. He really had to go, his bowels were loose. He did it 
very quickly, then reached behind the enamel water cabinet 
un^ his hand touched the small, blunt-nose gun fastened with 
tape. He ripped the gun loose, remembering that Qemenasa 
had said not to worry about leaving prints on the tape. He 
shoved the gun into his waistband and buttoned his jacket 
over it. He washed his hands and wet his hair. He wiped his 
prints off the faucet with his handkerchief. Then he left the 
toilet. 

Sollozzo was sitting directly facing the door of the toilet, his 
dark eyes blazing with alertness. Michael gave a smile. * Now I 
can talk,’ he said with a sigh of relief. 

Captain McGuskey was eating the plate of veal and spaghetti 
that had arrived. The man on the far wall had been stiff with 
attention, now he too relaxed visibly. 

Michael sat down again. He remembered Gemenza had told 
him not to do this, to come out of the toilet and blaze away. 
But either out of some warning instinct or sheer funk he had 
not done so. He had felt that if he had made one swift move he 
would have been cut down. Now he felt safe and he must have 
been scared because he was glad he was no longer standing on 
his legs. They had gone weak with trembling. 

Sollozzo was leaning towards him. Michael, his belly covered 
by the table, unbuttoned his jacket and listened intently. He 
could not understand a word the man was saying. It was 
literaUy gibberish to him. His mind was so fiUed with pound- 
ing blood that no word registered. Underneath the table his 
right hand moved to the gun tucked into his waistband and he 
drew it free. At that moment the waiter came to take their 
order and Sollozzo turned his head to speak to ^e waiter. 
Michael thrust the table away from him with his left hand and 
his right hand shoved the gun almost against Sollozzo’s head. 
The man’s coordination was so acute that he had already begun 
to fling himself away at Michael’s motion. But I^chael, 
younger, his reflexes sharper, pulled the trigger. The bullet 
caught Sollozzo squarely between his eye and his ear and 
when it exited on the other side blasted out a huge gout of 
blood and skull fragments on to the petrified waiter’s jacket. 
Instinctively Michael knew that one bullet was enough. 


*55 



SoUozzo had turned his head in that last moment and he had 
seen the light of life die in the man's eyes as clearly as a candle 
goes out. 

Only one second had gone by as Michael pivoted to bring 
the gun to bear on McQuskey. The police captain was staring 
at Solloz2o with phlegmatic surprise, as if this had nothing to 
do with him. He did not seem to be aware of his own danger. His 
veal-covered fork was suspended in his hand and his eyes were 
just turning on Michael. And the expression on his face, in his 
eyes, held such confident outrage, as if now he expected 
hfichael to surrender or to run away, that Michael smiled at 
him as he pulled the trigger. This shot was bad, not mortal. It 
caught McQuskey in his thick bull-like throat and he started 
to choke loudly as if he had swallowed too large a bite of the 
veal. Then the air seemed to fill with a fine mist of spra 3 red 
blood as he coughed it out of his shattered lungs. Very coolly, 
very deliberately, Michael fired the next shot through the top 
of his white-haired skuU. 

The air seemed to be full of pink mist. Michael swung to- 
wards the man sitting against the wall. This nuin had not made 
a move. He seemed paralysed. Now he carefully showed his 
hands on top of the table and looked away. The waiter was 
staggering back towards the kitchen, an expression of horror 
on his face, staring at Michael in disbelief. SoUozzo was sdll in 
his chair, the side of his body propped up by the table. Mo- 
Quskey, his heavy body pulling downward, had fallen off his 
chair on to the floor. Michael let the gun slip out of his hand so 
that it bounced off his body and made no noise. He saw that 
neither the man against the wall nor the waiter had noticed 
him dropping the gun. He strode the few steps towards the 
doof and opened it. Sollozzo’s car was parked at the kerb still, 
but there was no sign of the driver. Michael turned left and 
around the comer. Headlights flashed on and a battered 
sedan pulled up to him, the door swinging open. He jumped 
in and the car roared away. He saw that it was Tessio at the 
wheel, his trim features hard as marble. 

*Did you do the job on SoUozzo?’ Tessio asked. 

For that moment Michael was struck by the idiom Tessio 
had used. It was always used in a sexual sense, to do the job on 

156 



a woman meant seducing her. It was curious that Tessio used 
it now. ‘ Both of them/ Michael said. 

‘ Sure ? ’ Tessio asked. 

"T saw their brains/ Michael said. 

There was a change of clothes for Michael in the car. 
Twenty minutes later he was on an Italian freighter slated for 
Sicily. Two hours later the freighter put out to sea and from 
his cabin Michael could see the lights of New York Qty 
buri^g like the fires of hell. He felt an enormous sense of 
relief. He was out of it now. The feeling was familiar and he 
remembered being taken off the beach of an island his Marine 
division had invaded. The battle had been still going on but he 
had received a slight wound and was being ferried back to a 
hospital ship. He had felt the same overpowering relief then 
that he felt now. All hell would break loose but he wouldn’t be 
there. 

On the day after the murder of Sollozao and Captain Me- 
Quskey, the police captains and lieutenants in every station 
house in New York City sent out the word ; there would be no 
more gambling, no more prostitution, no more deals of any 
kind until the murderer of Captain McCluskey was caught. 
Massive raids began all over the city. All unlawful business 
activities came to a standstill. 

Later that day an emissary from the Families asked the Cor- 
leone Family if they were prepared to give up the murderer. 
They were told that the affair did not concern them. That 
night a bomb exploded in the Corleone Family mall in Long 
Beach, thrown firom a car that pulled up to the chain, then 
roared away. That night also two button men of the Corleone 
Family were killed as they peaceably ate their dinhfer in a small 
Italian restaurant in Greenwich Village. The Five Families War 
of 1946 had begun.
